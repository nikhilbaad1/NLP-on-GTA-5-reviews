"even 8 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy.whilst gta online has gone in a direction i don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - i can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in gta online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it.single player is also undeniably a brilliant experience. even though it will take you a while to get through to the end of the story, there's really no excuse for not playing it through at least once.a lot of us have got a bit tired of this game in the many years since it's original release, but from an objective point of view, even if this game released for the very first time this year, it would still be one of the best video games ever made and blow us all away.the driving is much easier than gta 4, literally anyone can be a decent driver in gta 5 unless you have brain damage, but i guess it makes it more accessible, lol. shooting is also much improved and is high quality, and those two elements combined with many others, including but not limited to the excellent map, make this game a perfect sandbox.",5,262,Good

"grand theft auto v is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by rockstar north and published by rockstar games. it is the first main entry in the grand theft auto series since 2008's grand theft auto iv. set within the fictional state of san andreas, based on southern california, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber michael de santa, street gangster franklin clinton, and drug dealer and arms smuggler trevor philips—and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful crime figures. the open world design lets players freely roam san andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of los santos, based on los angeles.the game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. the story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. a ""wanted"" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. grand theft auto online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.the game's development began soon after grand theft auto iv's release and was shared between many of rockstar's studios worldwide. the development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as red dead redemption and max payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around california to capture footage for the design team. the game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. it was released in september 2013 for playstation 3 and xbox 360, in november 2014 for playstation 4 and xbox one, and april 2015 for microsoft windows. playstation 5 and xbox series x versions are scheduled to release in late 2021.extensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first three days. it received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. however, it caused controversies related to its depiction of violence and women. considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made, it won year-end accolades including game of the year awards from several gaming publications. it is the second best-selling video game of all time with over 135 million copies shipped and one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time, with about $6 billion in worldwide revenue.",5,51,Good

"warning: spoilerstrevor is just love!! he has these tough guy looks and energetic and humorous dialog that makes him better than the other two characters. i think i'll spend the first few weeks playing only him before michael and franklin.i laughed so hard when he was shouting at the cops chasing after him,he isn't much of a hot-headed guy, he's cool most of the time(at least for the time i was free roaming).most of the gta fans see him as a sociopath but i think michael deserves to be called that too.a big thumbs up to the voice actors for bringing life into these characters.i started exploring the massive world gta v offers and i must say the craftsmanship is simply stunning. it is clear that it was designed and implemented by people who really wanted to produce something that was revolutionary, and without skimping on the details.it seems almost limitless. from ai cars flashing their high beams when you're driving on the wrong side of the road on a collision course with them, to the seamless integration of the radio stations with the world you're in, to . . . well, a dozen pages could be written on the details alone.the world is massive! if one word could sum up the game i think it would be 'detail'. every aspect of the game is as detailed as possible and it is easily the best game ever made respective of the technological possibility in 2013. for instance, the ai of the people walking down the street is almost creepy, it seems like these are living people. the dialog is truly impressive, i believe that this game could compete with some of the best films around.fantastic acting, worthy of film awards, breathtaking graphics, beyond realistic physics, and just enthralling game-play make this the first truly next-gen game that goes beyond just better graphics, pushing the limits of what i thought was possible.rockstar is genius for a making this game so immerse, so realistic, but yet manages to keep that funny, satiric gta feel. congrats rockstar, you deserve your success.",5,5,Good
"story mode: gta 5 is an action-based game that takes place in the state of san andreas but in the city of los santos. you play as three main protagonists, the first for a grand theft auto game. one of the characters you play as is michael townley who fakes his own death to get out of the life of crime under the witness protection of the fib under a new name, michael de santa. he's now living in los santos with his two children and his wife, amanda. our second main protagonist is franklin clinton. like michael, franklin results to a life of crime such as robbing liquor stores and warehouses, anything for some of the needed money. he too lives in los santos where he stays with his auntie, denise. franklin commits active crimes and does kill gang members but he isn't stupid and he tries to branch out from the hood life so him and his crush tanisha can live somewhere away from all of it. our third and final protagonist is trevor phillips. he is the first character in gta that actually works, his personality being a sociopathic narcissist who will kill for fun, actually matches the setting of randomly blowing things up and running people over. trevor and michael were buddies back in the old heist days, they'd do scores together until it all went south and michael faked his own death, leaving trevor m.i.a only to return later in the game watching the news and hearing about michael being potentially alive. this game is amazing, which is an understatement but the open world is gigantic with several different landmarks and terrain as you drive around. the gameplay feels smoother than it ever has before, with even faster cars, even bigger guns, and even more people to shoot at. the storyline might not be the most interesting, but actually being able to plan a heist and pick who you want to hack and drive and provide firearms is mental. making stupid decisions for a heist can also affect how it goes down, you may lose money, someone might die, it's just crazy how in-depth the game gets. the game can get slow at times but if you wanna take a break from the main story, do some side quests which are referred to as ""strangers and freaks"". 100% completion of this game doesn't come easy it will take some grinding and some time consumption in order to acquire the 100% you may need to watch youtube videos for help. overall the story mode to this game is top-notch and i give rockstar props for creating such a banger of a game.",0,1025,Bad
"grand theft auto v is a best action,adventure and a fps shooter game with 2 fascinating modes story mode and online mode, the developers done a very hard working procedure on making a spellboundic game with breathtaking euphoria physics. the overall story mode experience is 10/10 in my opinion with a lot of mind blowing easter eggs,secrets and plenty of more stuff and also the missions have variety of physics and realism. from 2011 the hype of grand theft auto v was from streets to the skies but it's still have a hype in 2020 like the developers rockstar games and rockstar north will make single player dlc unlike r* said on 2015 they won't make any dlc for story mode except online mode but now to remain and increase the hype and get milk i guess they will make a single player dlc which will not be free unlike gta online dlc updates,but then on 2013 the rockstar services wants to make the grand theft auto world a real living world by adding multiplayer features in game eh but in 2021 gta online will become a standalone game it will detach from gta v. so on gta online gives all players across the world a overheimengly positive living open world game experience of mutliplayer with tons of different cool dlc updates in game of online mode like refreshing the game mode with tons of various new activities so on the gta online mode made the whole game live a more better life and giving a lot profit for the developers like this game has sold a tons of copys from 2013 to 2020 and so on rockstar games made alot of money from a single game also their isn't a movie which scored a lot of money than gta v.well so i recommend this game to whom who haven't played yet i recommend it to play once and then you are going to live in this breathtaking open world game. the game is going to be expanded and enhanced on story mode after it's release on ps5. so hang on and hope for the best.",5,273,Good
"credit where credit is due, this game is fairly enjoyable.  the story mode is entertaining and engrossing, los santos and the surrounding area feels vibrant and alive, and there are a seemingly infinite amount of things to see and do.  that being said, once you get over the scope of the game and all the tiny details, you begin noticing all of the flawed/broken mechanics.  every car handles similarly, regardless of vehicle type, which is to say they all handle poorly.  traction control is applied at random, and is absent at launch, but present while cornering.  the most mundane econobox and the most visceral hypercar have relatively the same top speed, which isn't very high.  with that in mind, land vehicles are still the ""best"" mode of transportation, even better than walking.  on foot movement is slow and sloppy.  precise movement is near impossible.  your character will ragdoll for the silliest of reasons, from trying to walk up a hill, to literally walking on a flat path.  helicopters are the worst.  piloting them ranges from slightly annoying to an all-out nightmare.  flying forward reduces altitude, stopping quickly throws the vehicle in to a fit.  engaging enemy aircraft is an exercise in anger management.  firearms are clunky and underpowered.  anything short of a headshot requires an excessive amount of rounds to down an enemy combatant, exacerbated by a poorly implemented auto aim system, which is all but necessary when playing with a controller.  the system struggles with even minimal visual obstruction (foliage, leaves), and loses targets at the worst possible moment.the story mode has all but been abandoned, not seeing any significant update in years.  all of r*s attention has been focused on the online portion, which doesn't bode well for their dev team.  load times are insane, lobbies are always overcrowded, and the servers crash constantly, most notably after finishing an activity.  speaking of the online experience, prepare for one of the most toxic multiplayer experiences to date.  trying to accomplish a delivery mission?  some griefer on an oppressor is about to ruin your day.  trying to perform one of the randomly generated community events, like driving the longest distance without crashing?  one of the npcs just crossed the street and t-boned you, even though there is nowhere for them to go on your side of the road (this behavior has apparently been hard coded into the game, because why wouldn't it be?).  so, aside from server issues, enemy players constantly harassing you, and suicidal npcs flocking towards your speeding vehicle, the rest of the experience is pleasant, right?  no.  the absolute worst aspect of the online mode, and the game as a whole, is the economy.  everything is grossly inflated compared to the story mode (e.g. $1,000,000+ for a honda civic, $15,000 shoes), and getting any meaningful amount of money requires grinding the same heists over and over (most of which require a crew and don't pay well), selling goods via your various companies (which also require help, or payout less if completed solo), the new solo compatible cayo perico heist (which is plagued with it's own laundry list of bugs and design flaws), or of course, shark cards (microtransactions), because if you're going to punish your fanbase for playing your over hyped game, why not hit them where they are the most vulnerable: their wallet?",2,87,Bad
"on launch day, i was one of the people that preordered the power armor edition not even 4 hours after it became available. after hearing so many bad reviews and general disgust about the game, i was worried that the fallout 76 game i decided to take a chance in and play was going to be shelved and done with in one to two months from launch date like other games i have played. boy was i wrong. at first, it seemed very hard to grasp whether bethesda would commit and improve the game. however, since being in the beta stages for the game, i have seen the game improved drastically. sure, it is not all clean and polished but they are putting updates out every two weeks, which says a lot in terms of improving the game. they have included more patches and fixes to previously buggy and game breaking gameplay. i just wanted to get the correct information out there so i will be explaining some of things they have done so you can see the work they put in for the last 5 to 6 months. i have enjoyed steady and more stable server use as the months go on since launch date. they are cracking down on anything that is viewed as cheating (duping weapons and modded versions of the game). they have increased the storage size to twice the amount since release date, i hope they increase it more in future updates. they even had time to add more content to this game, and they are working on getting more patches. dungeon will be coming out (so excited to fight strong enemies whenever i enter with a group to see how far we can go). they have made a survival mode pvp server worlds that are different and separate from the pve server worlds in case you do not like pvp and just want to explore the world (also they have implemented a new system where if someone attacks you, you will not receive damage or die from the attacker unless you attack them back). i haven't really come across players that are mean or want to make sure you have a bad time in fallout 76. for example, i met a good player the other day who gave me a ton of serum mutations that cost about 60-70k in total caps (which is hard to get that amount in fallout 76 especially from vendors) for free without wanting anything in return. apparently, he gives them out for free to anyone that needs help. so i don't believe everyone in fallout 76 are toxic players, but some of us try to help each other out when we can. i have enjoyed being able to name my stuff, have stronger and  more farsighted turrets than before.  they have changed the mechanics of some monsters (scorchbeast as an example and spamming attacks). they have fixed more quest buggy issues and helped pool vendors caps together so you dont have to run around looking for caps. they made sure to let vendors have multitude of notes so you don't rely on rng to get the plan you need for a gun or power armor part. they have gotten rid of the spawning issue for robots in whitesprings. they have started putting good stuff in atomic shop like cool looking power armor. they have put a news and announcement board when you enter into the game. they added a new battle royale mode and already started putting out updates to fix the battle royale mode. also, they are planning to release human npcs, which will be an awesome addition to the game along with vault raids! nice! these are just some of the updates they have been doing since the game launched and they have been true to their word doing two updates every single month. i am eager to see what other updates they have going forward. also, i have received my new canvas bag, which looks nice if i might add. they fulfilled their promise to deliver this bag in the timeframe they gave us so i do not feel like they scammed me or anything. to me, every dollar well spent, and i am in no way regretting my purchase unlike how others have been making it seem with the classic ""people are still playing this game?"" i can assure you others are playing and like me we will be playing it for quite a while.",0,332,Bad
"my go-to game when i've had enough of the real world and want to escape reality for some time. expands well upon that one mechanic every other gta title missed - immersion. drive around the posh vinewood streets looking for exotic sports cars or explore the grand senora desert and expect random encounters with muggers or hitchhikers, or take a u-turn and climb mt. chiliad, to feel on top of the world. the game comes with endless hours of gameplay even after completing all the missions, and the first-person mode coupled with your own tracks makes even aimless driving feel fun. the only downside is the wanted level system, which activates even when you stealthily kill a random npc in the middle of the desert in the dead of the night. nevertheless, the game is efficiently optimized on all its ports, which allows it to run even on low-end machines. the gameplay physics is spectacular, but in no way you must expect it to be near real-life since gta v's not supposed to be a simulation game. in the end, this game will make you forget all your real-life problems for a while, as you step into the shoes of either franklin, michael or trevor and feel the los santos sensation.",5,46,Good
"good gmae i like anime though so it makes it a bit worse but honestly i think that its a good game despite bad press and bad button pressing and overall i think its a good game but i also think that that one character called steven is pretty overused when you find him late game, not a spoiler, just a random encounte that people can encounter and yeah so its reallly a good game its just a bit unbalanced in the fact that you can get kachowed by some absolute unit in the first 20 minutes of online play. don't forget the fact that the submarine has an air limit and makes life dificicult when my controller dies and i have to go to the store to go get a new controller and a new headset (unrelated but it was expensive) if only there were some giveaways am i right? nah but really its a good game but the balance is oof and too many ships and nothing to spend money on tha t is of direct use other than guns, but after that its the large amount of things to buy that make  it really annoying and unbalanced escpecially the taxations so just like in real life tax evade.yeah tax evasion is actually a neat mechanic irl and in the irs office in game. it looks like a normal building but like the government they are not what they seem so its now a tax building, not as run down as it used to be of coursei just want some friendsto play with of course, i have plenty of friends. the xbox group posts i havnt cheacked out but i do believe that its pretty good. to be completely honest i just hope the teaming up is balanced i love balanced games like assasins creed odyessy. its pretty neat also. yeah so really just a good game and i really really just super much want some friends to play the fun and a bit boring and lame game with me.dont worry though i have plenty of friends who also tax evadebut y'know how it is nowadays for an 'evader' such as myself.anyway, this is just youre friendly neighbourhood gamer who likes balance as much as the next guy and has a bunch of gam er mates",0,496,Bad
"this is an amazing open world game even 8 years later! its graphics are as great as more modern open world games such as just cause 4 and watchdogs legion.the story is a heartwarming masterpiece and the voice acting paired with the realistic motion capture is stunning. if you love cars, boats, planes and helicopters then you'll definitely love the vehicle related features in the game, i was blown away by the vast variety of customisations available for cars! from coloured tire smoke and neon light kits to brilliant accessories and body kits! there's  something for everyone here, i do have to say to keep little children away though. but otherwise it's perfect for older teens and adults alikeand that's just the story mode! there is a whole world available to play with your friends or with randoms!",5,16,Good
"after i joined college i started playing pc games, and that was the time i began learning about gaming outside of nintendo. open world games were something that really fascinated me, so that was the genre i started from. i played assassin's creed and watch_dogs, but i didn't understand why normies liked gta so much. i thought it must be because they don't know about bigger ad cooler games, until i tried gta v myself. and i have to say, boy was i so wrong! this really is something unique, something i couldn't get in any other open world aaa game i had played to that point.gta v is something i'd call the era defining game of our time. it has everything we want: a good story, interesting characters, a dynamic open world, interactive npcs and most importantly, it can run on any device (other than nintendo and mobile phones). i have a habit of playing games linearly, that is, going from point a to point b. i only care about the story of a game and explore the open world only after i complete the main story mode, so that i can delete the game in case my laptop starts going slow (it's an nvidia 940mx), and also because i have too many unplayed games in my library and i'd choose to finish them rather than look at a game whose story i've already completed.and that made it even more engaging; because the story is really gripping and funny at the same time. in the beginning i was annoyed when michael was shown the first time, putting his gun on franklin's head. but after michael's family left him i was really interested in knowing how he will fix things back. but then the scene shifted to trevor. i was really annoyed, and i would always shift to michael to finish his quests. but after i replayed the game after it became free on epic, i realised trevor's story was the funniest of them all. now trevor has become my favourite character of the three.the graphics are really realistic. and the best part is, if you have a high end pc you can download mods to make the game look as realistic as possible. there are even mods for bringing your own characters like superman or hulk, and the best part is that rockstar, unlike other aaa companies (read nintendo) encourages players to do it rather than punish them for the same. the npcs are also very interactive. they behave just like how any person in real life would. being an indie game developer myself i know how much effort goes behind doing this.just by looking at gta v you can see how much love the developers poured into making it. the game has been available for every console from the 7th generation and will also be for the 9th generation. gaming companies should learn from rockstar and take this example for their games too (especially ubisoft, assassin's creed ii would have been so awesome if it was remastered for ps5 and xbox series x). i really hope gta vi is able to outperform this game. they can take as much time as they want, i have no problem with it.",5,12,Good
"a very nice game with good graphics. it is actually pretty hard to think that a 2013 video game with stunning 4k graphics ('course when u can play in 4k with ur device) and if u are lucky enough to have an rtx 3090 and an 8k monitor, your mind will be absolutely blown to see a 2013 game have better graphics than a 2021 game or even future games and who knows even ps5 games. so, it also has a user friendly interface and really easy to use if you know the basics of gaming controls both on pc and console. the only pull back is the space consumed but i think that was a pull back till 2015. now, the way massive space is consumed by modern video games like cyberpunk 2077. it also has another advantage that it is not very glitchy. yes, it has glitches of course every game does. what i can tell u is that it is mostly popular for its open world play which adds even more points of interest and more stunning details!! if you tell me i recommend gta v, yes! i definitely do!!",5,17,Good
"everyone has heard of gta v. i no longer play the game, but i thoroughly enjoyed the time in which i did. i'm not going to bother talking about the campaign in detail but i will say this - a perfect video game should feel like a film where you are the main character and this game achieved that at every opportunity. as for the online mode, in my opinion, as a semi stand-alone game in itself, it is the greatest game ever made for its time. it was so exciting to play a sandbox game with such an in-depth level of graphical detail at the time of the new console release not only on your own, but crucially with your friends. the number of hours some people have put into this game, the staggering revenue it has generated and the fact that it is still one of the most updated and relevant games even in 2019 can only stand as strong evidence to back up my previous claim. (don't bully me i haven't played rdr2 i'm waiting for pc release to experience it). it is the quintessential game to the industry and a testament to what a video game is and should be.",0,153,Bad

"saddam hussein abd al-majid al-tikriti (/hʊˈseɪn/;[3] arabic: صدام حسين عبد المجيد التكريتي, romanized: ṣaddām ḥusayn ʿabd al-majīd al-tikrītī;[a] 28 april 1937[b] – 30 december 2006) was an iraqi politician who served as the fifth president of iraq from 16 july 1979 until 9 april 2003.[8] a leading member of the revolutionary arab socialist ba'ath party, and later, the baghdad-based ba'ath party and its regional organization, the iraqi ba'ath party—which espoused ba'athism, a mix of arab nationalism and arab socialism—saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup (later referred to as the 17 july revolution) that brought the party to power in iraq.as vice president under the ailing general ahmed hassan al-bakr, and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government, saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflicts between the government and the armed forces. in the early 1970s, saddam nationalised the iraq petroleum company and independent banks, eventually leaving the banking system insolvent due to inflation and bad loans.[9] through the 1970s, saddam consolidated his authority over the apparatus of government as oil money helped iraq's economy grow rapidly. positions of power in the country were mostly filled with sunni arabs, a minority that made up only a fifth of the population.[10]saddam formally took power in 1979, although he had already been the de facto head of iraq for several years. he suppressed several movements, particularly shi'a and kurdish movements which sought to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively,[11] and maintained power during the iran–iraq war and the gulf war. he ran a repressive authoritarian government[12] notorious for its severe human rights abuses. the total number of iraqis killed by his government's police in various purges and genocides is conservatively estimated to be 250,000.[13] his invasions of iran and kuwait killed hundreds of thousands more.[14]in 2003, a coalition led by the united states invaded iraq to depose saddam. u.s. president george w. bush and british prime minister tony blair erroneously accused iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having ties to al-qaeda. saddam's ba'ath party was disbanded and the country's first democratic elections were held. after his capture on 13 december 2003, the trial of saddam hussein took place under the iraqi interim government. on 5 november 2006, saddam was convicted by an iraqi court of crimes against humanity related to the 1982 killing of 148 iraqi shi'a and sentenced to death by hanging. he was executed on 30 december 2006.[15]",5,4,Good
"i like how the other reviews sound like wikipedia articles. here's an actual review from an actual person. if you said that gta v is the best game of all time, i wouldn't argue with you. what rockstar did for gaming with this absolute masterpiece cannot be understated. we're still playing it religiously 7 years after it came out. 7 years. let that sink in. the use of 3 protagonists was a great idea and really branched out this game in ways we've never seen before. getting 3 different perspectives of the same story is extremely interesting. each of the protagonists hold their own, trevor is easily one of my favorite protagonists ever, i love the al pacino vibe that michael gives off and franklin's journey is awesome to see. the gameplay is top notch. i love the gunplay and the driving is stellar, it's much better than the boat steering from gta 4. the story is incredible, there isn't much of an emotional attachment, but it's still extremely compelling and can easily last for multiple playthroughs. i replay this game once a year because i love it so much. the map is one of the best out there, there's a reason it's used when judging the maps of new games. online is a completely different story, it's toxic and is pay to win. it's fun with friends, but random lobbies are awful. overall, gta v is a 10/10. there's really nothing that can bring down the score.",5,46,Good
"unparalleled in open world rpg and also now in mmorpg with the gta online.this game was and still is far ahead of its time because of the sheer details that developers have added to everything ranging from fps, world building, story, physics & game mechanics, cars, characters and a lot more. as if this wasn't enough, now gta online is a mmorpg where you can create your own character and do activities and missions with friends. it is just so vast and also has tons of new cars!this game set the bar high for other open world games that came out after it and still is a standard for future games.i highly recommend immersing yourself in the experience called gta v because this game came out in 2013 and still is talked about today and will be talked about for generations to come.",5,41,Good
i would like to start this review by saying that gta v is in my top 5 favourite video games of all time. the single player story mode is breathtaking and the opportunity to switch between 3 characters that all have there own distinct personalties you get attached to is incredible. you get immediately hooked on the story because of its dark humour and constant twists and turns. now moving on to gta online. the plethora of different ways you can approach gta online is one of the modes biggest strengths.you can be that one guy that always destroys someone else's cargo or you can be a multi millionaire ceo. the multitude of different things this mode offers cannot be described in words. everyone has to experience this!,5,34,Good
"the attentian to detail is amazing. im a car enthusiast so i love trying to collect all the cars. when i got the game i didnt know it would be this good. im getting it almost 8 years after it released and its quickly become my favorite game. from the blow off valve sounds in a turbocharged vehicle to sound of an engine cooling down after its been turned off i continue to find evidence of rockstars hard work to make this game realistic and fun at the same time. cant wait for the next one, hopefully they have some of my favorite artist on the radio (pierre bourne). amazing job guys.",5,40,Good
"what a game!i remember so much when this game came out c. 2013, this game was all the craze. it wasn't until 2 years later i finally got it for myself, however. when i first got the game, i had high expectations after rockstar had just released some incredible games in the last 10 years (red dead, bully, max payne, gta iv, etc.) i will not be covering online in this review, just story mode. like i said, i had high hopes for rockstar in this game, and boy did they not disappoint! unlike past games, you have the option to choose between 3 different protagonists throughout the story mode, each of which having their own sets of missions. many features returned to the game from gta iv, such as strangers and freaks, but were heavily revamped. let's take a look at cletus, a random strangers and freaks mission assigned to trevor phillips, the 3rd introduced protagonist. you get to go around the town hunting just like real life. once you complete this mission, you can go hunting with cletus another time in paleto bay, and after that you can go whenever you please. i also love the fact that the side characters play such a huge role in the game, like lester or amanda for example.. without these characters the game wouldn't be the same. if gta vi isn't as good as this, i'm going to be so mad!",5,25,Good
"fantastic game. driving is super easy to pick up but hard to master (exactly what i want in a driving game). the game world is full of exquisite visual details/ the cars also look great. storytelling/ character are also top notch; having the three separate characters from completely different worlds gives the player three unique perspectives. shooting is fun too with great variety of weapons and customization to choose from. the music curation is also amazing, offering the best from several genres. there’s not much to dislike about this massive/ gorgeous game. only complaint: some missions are better than others. some missions can get very irritating very quickly (example: the one where you have to operate like 5 separate cranes in the shipping yard just about drove me nuts lol). also, flying planes/ helicopters kind of suck in this game imo. but both of the problems i’ve mentioned are minuscule when compared with the overwhelming awesomeness of this game. buy it if you haven’t already! offers a more immersive video game experience than just about any other game in the market (i love returning to my home in the hollywood hills that is paid for with dirty money hahaha).",5,2,Good
"i have spent my life watching my cousins and family play this game and for my birthday my parents got me the game (2015). this games story mode had me intrigued with the game and its the perfect story for anyone to enjoy. but for the icing on the cake they also have a online story mode that has new content at least 2 to 3 times each year which has me playing that even after 2015 and finishing the story the content features businesses,crime org, bunkers,nightclubs,and facilitys to do missions to earn money all of these dlcs feature new weapons and new cars refreshing the games popularity. i have spent well over 10,000 hours even while i was sick i would wake up to play this game. i have took breaks from the games but i always came back to the game due to the updates and my friends not just that its such a good game i would recommend to people who are mature and not under 17 im not a pro but i would love to see a new player base its up to parents to decide if they want their kids playing but as long as they know that its a game and if you do this in real life there will be consequences",5,60,Good
"ok this will be as short as i can make it.i bought this game in belief that yeah it’s a good game but i mean nothing beats san andreas right? wrong this game is one of the best games a person can ever play. it’s very long which is a plus and just thinking about the how the missions were thought of and how well the story line was made makes your mind boggle, i mean they got a custom radio in that game with amazing songs. i’ve had my fair share of video game experiences, i have played almost all gta games, i’ve played the just cause series, the batman series is great and can’t forget the assassin’s creed series but this game a little different. it is something closer to how the real shiz would be and how good a video game can be. tldr then, absolutely brilliant, if you haven’t played this game man you practically haven’t lived cause i literally cried after finishing the 100% mark. “100/10” - me.",5,47,Good
"gta online has been around for about 5 years now and that is just on pc. unfortunately, rockstar has their priorities in a very anti-consumer way.  they don’t do anything about modders allowing the same players to go for months on end ruining the sessions of all the other players.  i have had to stay out of free-roam lobbies with more than about 4 or 5 people as anything larger and there is guaranteed to be at least 1 modder that will ruin my experience by randomly exploding me, teleporting me, kicking me out of my vehicle (even in aircraft), griefing in god mode, freezing me so i can’t move, and even crashing my game back to desktop.  using the in-game report function doesn’t do anything as players need many reports to be flagged, and many of the mods have report protection so it boots you from the session when you report.  this is unacceptable that rockstar don’t do anything, and in all my years of video games since the dawn of the internet this game has the worst amount of cheating i have ever experienced.  it has caused me to lose millions in money over the years.           what is even worse is that they ban or reset accounts for players who use money glitches just a few times even though rockstar’s poor coding allow these glitches to happen.  in the past they have also just money wiped players who abuse glitches or done nothing at all, not even given warnings to the players with only the worst offenders who glitch over a billion dollars getting reset.  so when they reset the account of players who have been playing for years and logged 100s of hours who only got 30 or 40 million in a money glitch this is a very abusive practice.  their inability to enforce, and unwantedness to do anything about modders encourages players to abuse glitches so it is just very unethical of them to take such harsh measures to players who money glitch, especially when they have such a spotty and inconsistent enforcement record.  a rollback of accounts a few days to before the glitches were discovered would be a much more appropriate measure, but rockstar choses to treat their playerbase in a very disrespectful manner instead. the game itself also has many connection related issues such as infinite loading, and disconnections that causes players to lose a lot of money due to failed heists, missions, and business sales.  many of the missions have been fun, but a lot of the missions, particularly the business ones are unimaginative reskins of one another where you just play delivery boy driving a product from one side of the map to the other in a preset slow vehicle. the support services is also among the worst i have come across in video games.  they outsource it to a different company that just has people who do nothing but copy paste scripted lines linking to the faq so when you have a question that can’t be answered by the faq then you never get any assistance. it is a pity rockstar have gone down the route of treating their consumers like trash, but it sadly is representative of much of the video game market these days.",1,111,Bad
"grand theft auto v has an average metacritic score of 97% across all platforms it's been released on, and is currently the third best selling game of all time, right behind tetris and minecraft. for both the average player and the long time rockstar fan who has seen the series evolve into what it is now, it's not difficult to see why: you play as three different characters--who all have their own unique backgrounds, goals, and motivations--in a surprisingly large and detailed satirical (and arguably accurate) replica of los angeles and the surrounding california area (dubbed los santos and san andreas respectively), where our three protagonists end up working together to pull off various heists while simultaneously trying to get out of the mess they've been pulled into.but what if i told you, seven years after it's release, across two generations of consoles, the story and character development wasn't the key to this game's success?that end is owed to it's online counterpart. which is, in many cases, for better or for worse.since grand theft auto online (gtao)'s release, the game has received several updates, ranging from customizable races that would make any person who grew up with hot wheels scream in joy, more replicas and mashups of existing cars available for purchase than the average player knows what to do with, to a casino and purchasable high-end apartments that allows you to plan heists with your friends. that being said, if you're new to this game, you're going to be extremely overwhelmed for what is major update upon major update, and phone calls upon phone calls telling you to buy a facility or a bunker. that, combined with the abyssmal loading times (which has been dubbed by the player base as ""cloud simulator 2013""), is something that will ward off many players.and that's not even covering the massive amount of tryhards and the wide array of weaponized vehicles they will use to stop you from making money in the game. and in order to make money in this game, you're going to have to grind repetitive missions and tasks in order to do it. a lot.if you don't enjoy games that rely heavily on grinding in order to advance, along with the problems and how easy it is for another player to ruin it all, this may not be the game for you. and if you think rockstar games will go out of their way to make it easier: they won't. all because it pushes shark card sales (what gtao uses as monetization) so they can further make money in an investment they made seven years ago.so, to conclude this review, i'm leaving an open letter to any higher-up rockstar employee who reads this: you're already one of the biggest game dev giants, you have nine studios that you've ended up buying out and putting under your portfolio, and five of your titles are well within the top fifty bestselling games of all time excluding this one.why do you feel the need to further monetize your games with an online counterpart that has some form of a paid premium? why in the world is it never enough?with dan houser out of the picture from here on out starting next month, you need to be incredibly careful with your future titles. i fear the worst for grand theft auto vi.tl;dr version: story is alright and there's plenty to do, but if you're going to try out gtao take it with a grain of salt",4,31,Good
"the singleplayer campaign was hands down one of the most engaging experiences i've ever had which makes me wonder how they're going to top it with gta 6. the online component is great, it's fun, it's held my interest for years thanks to the heist update adding a ton of replay value. their dedication has really transformed the online portion of the game over the years into a powerhouse, albeit at the loss of singleplayer dlc which while i understand and i've come to terms with given gta:o's massive success and the multiple endings and sense of finality that came with the game's true route i'd be disappointed if we didn't get anymore singleplayer dlc because over the years it's been some of the most fun i've ever had. gameplay and graphics still hold up strong 5+ years after launch",5,28,Good

"so ive been thinking about how the mc community has become a major crew thing, with hardcor roleplay that is being organized via discord and other social media outlets. but what if they did a revamp in the mc and criminal mastermind updates, where they added a menue for mc presidents to manage clubs as far as members in other sessions, not just in the current session ur in. like manage crews but given titles, this could also be expanded to mobs,street gangs ect. however there is another issue that id like to bring up is there is alot of senseless killing in the mc community because there is no pros or cons to build working relationships with rivals. now a potential solution is the bunker update. insted of selling off guns and equipment to random  npc's this equipment can be sold to other mc's or gangs. now obviously the buyer should be given something for their hard earned money. rather then it just disappearing. so i propose like a buffed buffed weaponry type of thing, possibly a good way to introduce that rail gun we've all been loathing for. of cours rival mc's have an opportunity to crash the sale if they have the skills to smash and grab and exit the selling area. but different clubs can specialize in different products. same as diffrent family's can. and anything can be sold and distributed. this will make the mc and crew life way more in depth and kind of give a reason to not just kill anyone for fun. because of the relationships. now id also  suggests that they make a club fund to pay for these so no one member is paying for those supplies and money can be earned by doing club work and other activities and club members will be given salary based on position in the club.",4,13,Good

"gta online is also a noteworthy game to play and it has plenty of pros and cons in its own right. the ability to acquire properties, businesses, compete and/or cooperate with players makes this game an immersive experience and it makes you feel like you mature with your character. you will see your character grow from being a petty criminal doing small time jobs for lamar and gerald to becoming a successful mastermind criminal. while this model is rewarding, it is difficult and tedious to move up the ranks. this is especially true for those who are full time students and full time employees because they are time constrained. if you are time constrained, barely starting gta online, and still want to have fun in gta online i do suggest you purchase the criminal mastermind starter pack with is roughly $10. i added additional tips to save you the time from watching clickbait 10+ minute youtube videos.the criminal starter pack will give you $1 million, a ceo office, an apartment, mc clubhouse, vehicles, weapons, and clothes. these properties might not be the best locations, but they are a good way to start earning money and once you save up enough money you can get better locations. with the money you earn i do suggest you avoid splurging it on vehicles. the only vehicles worth buying right away is the kuruma and the oppressor. the kuruma will protect you when you do missions and the oppressor allows you to travel quickly across the map. for aircraft, invest in a buzzard and a cargobob. the buzzard is a great helicopter to use in missions due to its agility and its weapons allow easy kills. being a ceo also allows you to spawn a ceo in most situations. the cargobob is a must have if you intend to import and export vehicles.",5,7,Good
"grand theft auto has always held a place in my heart. back when i first picked up a copy of gta 3 i was blown away, and every game after that i loved dearly. but when i finally got around to playing grand theft auto 5 i couldn't help but be disappointed. don't get me wrong the game is still good (at least the story mode is) the soundtrack is great as most grand theft auto games have great soundtracks. and the visuals looked fantastic, it felt like a believable city. the story was alright, my only real complaints with it is that it was really short, and mostly driving to point a to b and then back to a. that and grand theft auto 5 is missing quite a bit of what grand theft auto 4 had, with physics being dumbed down and the car handling broken. (cars in gta 5 all feel the same, all luxury cars with supercar like acceleration even on thing like a family sedan) but that's not that bad compared to the online aspect.the online mode to this game that rockstar always promotes is not great. at all. with load times being around 10-ish minutes, and frequent disconnects the game can be borderline unplayable sometimes. the online is 𝐩𝐚𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐢𝐧 and is not fun to play at all, as a new player you are constantly thrown around by modders who rockstar does not punish or even make an attempt to fix. this and the fact that grand theft auto online is not a gta game, with flying motorcycles that can shoot 4 rockets per second, tracer bullets, explosive bullets, invincible cars, flying cars, homing missiles, and so much worse the game plays like an eight year old's dream. not a grand theft auto title. if i'm going to be honest here i would downright say that grand theft auto online is more of a saint's row clone than anything else. if you were looking for a grand theft auto online experience that fits with what the series has been for 20+ years, i would reccomend modding this game and getting the 5m mod, or you could get san andreas multiplayer (better in my opinion) what is essentially gta with 300 other players. it's disappointing such a series has fallen so far i think i may never play the next grand theft auto game (if it ever comes out) because if this is what grand theft auto is now,",2,7,Bad

"gta5 story mode-okay this game was great but it came out in 2009 and they have 0 effort to try and revamp anything like i mean anything. their online version gets updated bi weekly i can’t understand why they can’t add more features to their story mode. gta online- let’s make one thing clear, rockstar will force chokehold you with microtransactions and their shark cards. their content is sooooo frustrating. i gave in and bought a enterprise pack and it’s like pulling tar off a window annoying for 70% of the special cargo, vehicle cargo or counterfeit cash factory. you literally are forced to buddy up with someone who has bought the good tier items or you get destroyed by players or their npcs. i will also say, they do have sales on stuff but all of it is twice the value of story mode. the only nice thing about online is the ability to play with other people who are respectful. that is probably like 10% of their online population. otherwise it’s just aggressive people with an objective to mess with people. rockstar games- okay these people been around for a while and i’ve played a good few of their franchise: red dead redemption, rdr2, gta4, gta5 and mafia 3. their games have always have increasing graphics and story lines it’s a great open world game with tons of customization but i felt the biggest fault in their latest rdr2 game. this happens in all of rockstars games… and i don’t want to spoil it but their forceful ending and absolute requirement for arthur dying is a lousy excuse to not make alternative endings. like i can choose to have trevor killed in gta5 but i can’t choose whether or not i have tuberculosis. it’s not just that like if you don’t use the right item exactly when they want it then i guess you’re going to have to restart the mission. this was very bad in gta4… another problem with rockstar is they have released gta5 on 3 different console, perfectly fine if they added 4k and updated story mode but it’s the same game using the consoles new graphics engine to support better picture. new disk same game.?",2,0,Bad

"used to be my favourite game back in the 360/ps3 days, and now its just a saints row clone. stupid flying cars and bikes that fire missiles... matched only in stupidity by the endless grind that is gta online. rockstar said ""lets do away with any interesting missions and add butt loads of expensive stuff that can only be acquired by stomaching the mindless grind... or, with our extortionately priced shark cards if you actually have a life and aren't willing to spend 8 hours a day in our lazily created and overmilked open world!"", essentially twisting the arm of the consumer into buying their in-game currency. i mean, gta online's most expensive car on release was about $1 million... now the most expensive ones are upwards of 10. an $8 million shark card is the same price as a aaa game, but it can't buy you one piece of ""top-tier"" in game content? pathetic. i think gta will one day be referenced when the laws tighten up around these sorts of things... they've always tread upon dangerous territory. basically, i've wiped my hands of this game, and it shall not be missed, not for one effing minute. no doubt gta vi will approach their online platform in the exact same way, and i'm afraid that's exactly why i won't be buying it. you need to pay a aaa premium in order to gain access to more pay walls, making it a worthless buy for the casual player/non-hacker. you'll literally pay aaa prices to drive a prius around while somebody drops a nuke on your digital delusions of grandeur.  2 stars for the game i used to enjoy, 3 stars removed for ruining it.?",2,0,Bad
"one of my personal favorite games.  has a beautiful open world that you can explore from the very start.  a very detailed game with a fully working stock market, websites, shops, and an environment that feels so alive.  there are so many unique heists, and every single one makes you feel like a criminal.  even though it came out all the way back in 2013, it still passes as a great game.  there is an offline and online mode, so you can play with friends or engage in the great story mode.i would highly recommend it.",5,2,Good
"you should play this game if you actually like action games. this game can really go into a lot of categories and can be played in a lot of different ways .i personally enjoy the game because i enjoy earning money from jobs and spending on cars and clothes and doing more jobs. with this game you can actually imagine yourself grown (if your a kid) actually do things that grown folks do. that’s just my intake of it. overall the game to me has improved significantly by it’s graphics, its characters,  and its game objectives. i personally recommend it for people who like action and basically virtual life games. when playing these games you will actually feel like you’re in the game. so i would recommend that you play this game only if your over 13 because you will be exposed to a lot .",4,18,Good
"gta v is among the most classic games ever. the story line is so in depth, hollywood can make movies from this game. the missions are plentiful, side stories are captivating and customizations and locations are expansive. if you're not one to mind the 18+ themes then this is a must have in any gamer's collection whether casual gamer or enthusiast gamer. i have been so in love with the gta franchise ever since the original top down view of the first gta on the ps1 (which, by the way, i still have and play occasionally after 20 years).",5,12,Good
"by far the best open world game i have every played. absolutely incredible.i first played this game in 2015 when i was 16 at my friends house. never played the story, just messed around and did whatever i wanted. fast forward to 2019, i get the game for myself for my xbox one s and played the story mode. best story mode ever. it's hard to explain but it's just a well done fun story mode that really blends the game and characters together. it's so good that i played the story mode 4 times and have enjoyed it just as much as the last time.i grew up with this game and have had a lot of good memories playing this. it's a part of me and i'm grateful that i've had the opportunity to log almost 3,500 hours on this game. many more hours and late nights with energy drinks to come.?",5,0,Good
"this is a good game. the missions are top notch. all the gun mechanics and animation are amazing. the activities are shooting ranges, buying property, buying planes, going on heists and much more. the characters are professionally written in every way. each character has friends and an interesting background. it has giant open world and tons of side missions including find confession papers for a murder on a starlet in vinewood that happened in the 70s and finding spaceship parts for a special vehicle at end. the  papers and and spaceship parts are about 50 each. you can easily switch between the 3 protagonists in game. you can go on your phone and thats were you go on facebook (lifeinvader in game) and buy the planes and sports cars on the phone. you can get a lot of money in the game off of doing story mission heists. in free roam customize cars and clothes to buy. there is great ai and interesting easter eggs and dialogue. rockstar went all out on this game!",0,100,Bad
"this was a fantastic game!the game set in los santos is about franklin clinton, an aspiring gangster. michael de santa, a retired bank robber and trevor phillips, a terrifying psychopath performing the most dangerous heists while trying to avoid the government, army and even the entertainment industry.what i loved about this game was the story it has you feeling for these characters and when it comes to choosing the ending it was a tough decision, the heists like the bureau raid and the the big score are just gripping as they put you at the edge of your seat and are thrilling.overall would highly recommend!",5,13,Good
"came for the single player experience, left because of what happened with online.to elaborate, the single player experience of this game was so engaging and new considering you play as 3 different protagonists through a thoughtfully written story even with opportunities to make small but seemingly meaningful decisions here and there. i am actually disappointed the single player dlc was cancelled as i was highly looking forward to at least one more step in the gang's adventures. the map, vehicles and poi's are on a new level; it is crazy to think that a game world made in 2013 has more detail than any other game made before or after has up to this point in 2020. graphics are decent especially for its time but the game is starting to show age and is begging for a new iteration considering this game is 7 years old now. in addition the game on pc is very feasible to run; for example if running in 720p you can simply use intel integrated graphics for a playable, but not excellent experience. still, this is incredibly efficient for its gaming engine to do.the reason i took off a star is because of the online experience. the two gaping flaws with it are the toxic community and the spotty development. having an unfriendly community is one thing but to the point where hackers are abundantly crashing your game if they simply don't like you on their server is just ridiculous and petty. completely defeats the purpose of giving the online experience a serious shot. in addition, making money is pretty much entirely dependent on being around a community that always hinders your endeavors just for the fun of irritating you, which would have been alright if the money making methods didn't pay out so little for the grandiose time it takes to make it. which brings me to the development of this game; money is easy to hack in, hackers are abundant like birds in the servers, in game currency is laughably expensive, and no previously added piece of content is ever given improvement. what once felt like an expansive world to plunder and explore now is a condensed world of unnecessary and undesirable content ballooning to the point where it has popped and people are sick of playing and just want a new gta installment already.despite the online experience, this game is still one of the best in history as at least the single player experience is mind blowing and offers so much for what you pay for (or in the case of many new epic games players what you avoided paying for).",4,6,Good
"one of the best open world games even it was released at 2013 its graphics is even better than games which released in 2018-2020. you can enjoy playing 3 diffrent charecters at the same time. you can enjoy the vast open world of los santos which was presented in san andreas.with lot of missions and other activites like golf, bussiness, side missions etc. make this game extra addicted. and physics is also quite well. you will need a decent pc for playing this masterpiece.",5,2,Good
"grand theft auto v | 2015 | pc | played for: 205hhow can i objectively review this game? it is the best entry yet in the best gaming franchise.attention to detail, good graphics and physics, spot on sarcasm and humor.add a original story, living and breathing los angeles replica and you get a sandbox game where you can sink hundreds of hours withought getting bored.the gtaonline component is ever evolving and increasing the progression cap 7 years after release.an absolute must play, for any age and any taste.story: 9,8/10gameplay: 10/10graphics/physics: 9,8/10music/sound: 10/10overall: 9,89/10",5,4,Good

"i think this game is absolutely garbage! this game has multiple glitches that prevent you from playing the game at it’s full capacity. it’s always glitching and lagging so you can’t even enjoy the game. needs multiple improvements. if they wernt so worried about making gta 6 that won’t ever come out or trash red dead 2 online this wouldn’t be a problem. edit: this game is so trash and ridiculously garbage that it makes me sick. i can never join a lobby wi th my friends in it. it takes 5 million years (not exaggerating) just to load up to a screen that says i couldnt join in many different ways of saying it. they come out with updates all the time instead of fixing what already broken. ohhhh and i just remebered theres a glitch that steals all your pistol ammo away from you when you do a mission. dont have me pay the ridiculous price of $25,000 to refill my ammo if you are just gonna take it away again. have a good day!edit # 2: here we are again with this garbage game. i gave it a second chance because it’s a great game. buttttt its proved its a hot piece of garbage that belongs in the smelly trashcan beside my house! i logged on when it said if i logged on in a certain time period i would get $500,000 dollars. yet here we are one message from xbox later about receiving my money and yet rockstar hasnt given it to me.  i stand by my previous review. have a terrible day, hate me",1,102,Bad
[re-edit] on a scale to 10 i gotta give gta5 a 6 its still a classic out of all the originals rockstar made but honestly why are we still paying for gold and psn on the remastered versions??? shouldn't gta online be free by now considering how many people still play it i just tried getting on solo mode on the ps4 version and it says i'm required to buy psn i dont mind the free version on ps3 but i kinda like the option to get access to all the newer content on the next gen console without paying so much for a 15 year old game like gta5!!!i also would like the option to play in crossplay mode with some of my friends i still keep in contact with on xbox friends and people ive known since 2005-2010 you know back when halo was still a thing and everyone was doing red vs blue videos for achievement hunter and making there own fail videos on gta halo trickshots on cod etc etc!!!crossplay mode on gta5 would work for console fans around regardless how the pc fanboys feel!!?,4,0,Good
"overrated and feels like the whole thing was designed for small children. the entire campaign holds your hand on every mission and if you fail you can just skip the mission. multiple protagonists make it difficult to really follow one solid story as a result none of the characters are very well thought out or developed unlike previous entry's in the franchise. gta 5 online which has now delayed gta 6 and made rockstar completely complacent and lazy to really put any work into the game. instead of gta online being the gritty, realistic crime drama with rpg elements that most looked forward to, we got an over the top saints row style online mode full of fake sci fi weapons and the same exact generic story about doomsday and aliens ect. that all players are forced to follow. no variety or passion in this franchise anymore.",1,20,Bad
"grand theft auto v is an  action based story orientated game developed by rockstar games and published by rockstar north . this story revolves around three friends who face the  consequence of the criminal underworld and can except trust each other. the city of los santos filled with gangs and corrupt police officials make trust, a pattern to lose . only one drawback of the game is it contains matured content that makes the games integrity to lose and to face bad reports or reviews for the game , so rockstar games it is a request to please remove the matured content like the sexual content to bring back the ray of hope to this game because this game focuses on real life scenarios and only the language and bad sexual content make it worst or else the story of the game is wonderful and the gaming physics are fabulous so please remove these two drawbacks of any gta game you are making to get back a 100 percent score rating. this story  also teaches about courage and heroism to fight of enemies. thanks for reading this feedback.

"gta 5, it is basically one of the top 5 to 10 best selling games of all time.i love gta 5:clapping_hands::clapping_hands:.it is basically a more modern universe, in terms of how today's society is.its been around for like 9 or 10 years now, it is everyone's favorite.but is it the best gta in my opinion, no it isn't. i would say, this goes 3rd best cause i still prefer gta 4 and gta san andreas over gta 5.but i still love this game. it have amazing selection of weapons, you can use 3 characters named michael, trevor and franklin. also, customizing your cars is awesome, hunting animals as trevor is amazing and even driving around for fun and being chased by the police is what made me love gta games.but here's what i don't like of gta 5:the combat is so terrible cause by 2 attacks they dead already, it feels too easy. the storyline is okay. but it didn't have a storyline that had wild factor all over it. and lastly, please get the basics like hotdog stands and food joints to chill. gta 5 is one of the top games i ever played. sure, it might not be my favorite, but it is definitely worth playing :smiling_face_with_sunglasses::smiling_face_with_sunglasses::smiling_face_with_sunglasses:?",5,0,Good
this game is absolutely amazing even still in 2020. i have bought and played hundreds of games and most of them don't even compare to the grand theft auto series. gta5 never seems to get old with an endless amount of things that you can do. i have played the game since 2015 and have got my account level up to 500!  rockstar games is an incredible company who never fails to put out awesome titles. this game will always have a special place in my heart and i will always support the gta series.,5,9,Good
"my opinion here, is mainly based on gta online.i never loved a game so much and hated it so much at the same time. it is great in every way that a game should be, plays great and there is so much to do. unfortunately it is let down by two things, other players and in game currency.that may sound like two small problems, but believe me there is nothing as annoying as other players just blowing you and your car away for no good reason. you are being hunted by some snot nosed kids who have spend half their lives playing this game, those above level 150 players. so you have all these things to do on this beautifully created world, where your life is turned into a living nightmare by a few other players. so in a nutshell if just want to play the game like a normal person, it just wont happen. too many snot nosed killers out there who have the best weapons, those irritating flying bikes that blows you into a black and white “waisted” slow motion screen. you then respawn and repeat.  that is basically gta online, it might just as well be called gta survive.  then there is the money factor,  oh my oh my, things are so ridiculously priced that it is one of the biggest money making schemes. you can buy in game currency that costs more than the game itself, at what point did we allow this to happen? oh yeah, it is those snot nosed kids spending all their cash on air scooters, and if you want to compete or at least stand a chance in this gta world, you will also need to buy some in game currency and get one of those air scooters. it is actually sad that it turned out like this, one huge battlefield that actually have no purpose other than spoiling the game for other people. why not go and play a pvp match, that is probably because this kind of behaviour is encouraged by the developer. but why? because it is no longer about making a game that can be enjoyed by millions, it is about making millions. the single player, remains one of the best game to date in my opinion, only sad to see the developers did not expand on that. i will not be surprised if the next gta will be an online only game with no single player.",2,6,Bad
"masterpiece. michael, franklin, and trevor may be different protagonists, but their chemistry is unlike anything else i've seen in a action game or even a film. rockstar picked the perfect music for the radio stations (my favorite is los santos rock radio). the missions and gameplay feel smooth and unique compared to other gta games. overall, it's one of my favorite games ever made and i'm never bored by it. (except for the oppressors, like seriously those suck the fun out of everything).",5,2,Good
"gta v was a great choice of selection. the story mode was a great story as it all comes together with some mysteries. gta v story mode allows people without online play to enjoy playing offline. gta v online is where the fun starts. you create a player, customizing his/her name, clothing, and what their genes are. then you will start your crime career. in online, there are multiple heists such as the doomsday heist, your high-end apartment heists, and the latest heist, the casino heist. the latest heist gives you full control over choices of how you will do the heist, and get a type of profit you will steal such as gold, cash, and paintings. also if you blow your cover, you can complete the heist, but it will turn into aggressive. at the casino, you can win the cars put up, buy spinning the lucky wheel once a day. a new car will spawn every week. the game is filled with lots of cars, planes, flying bikes, motorcycles, flying cars, helicopters and much more. you can buy businesses, apartments, and motorcycle clubs. these are just a few things you can do in gta v.",5,6,Good

"i love this game so, so much! high-octane story, the easily learned controls, the explosively good online mode, it's all great. but the online mode does seem to lose some of the thrill once you realize how hard it is to make money in it. rockstar, please make new, easier ways to get money. i love grinding bunker and cargo as much as the next person, but making a few million and then having to spend it on an over priced vehicle is not that good of a feeling. also, shark cards don't make mathematical sense. you're telling me that i need to spend 100 usd to get 8 million in the game? that'll probably last you about 2 or 3 days in game if you want to make that 8 mil worth it. you could probably get your self a bunker or a some biker businesses or maybe even a nightclub if you do things wisely. now, yes, that does sound like a pretty nice amount of stuff you can get for 8 million dollars in game, but is it worth spending 100 dollars when the premium edition, which comes with a bunch of free stuff is 30 dollars? i don't think so.",4,6,Good
"this game is so fun! it’s not a great game, however. it’s an ok-ish game with a lot of content. the reason that i view the game in such a way is due to the b a l a n c e   i s s u e s. i was about to buy the b- 11 strikeforce (resemblance of the a 10 warthog,) today until i saw that the thing isn’t good for attacking ground targets because the plane which is what the gun should have been built around sucks so “it won’t make other aircrafts obsolete” but you have a flying missile bike with outstanding tracking and is very very small in the game. really rockstar?? the only other problem i have is how expensive vehicles are. 800k for a doge challenger? i understand that rockstar wants you to buy their in game currency with real life currency but there are a lot of games where you max out and still have fun. gta v was designed in such a way where you have to sacrifice time and effort to have fun in the sandbox...",3,3,Normal

"this game is perfect. i'm going to speak on the story mode and online in separate sections since rockstar considers them separate games.story mode: story mode is the first thing you will play when you enter the game, and people who only like online games might go straight to the online after doing the first couple of missions but in my opinion, that's doing the game a huge injustice. the story mode has a great plot, interesting characters, good to great missions, even compared to older gtas, and so much to do with all three characters. if you're going to buy the game just for online, you might as well give this a try, its truly great.online: i am going to be reviewing online based on the game its self and not the player base. if i was reviewing on the player base than this game would be half a star. the game its self is great although. there is so much to do, you can own businesses, own apartments, garages, do tons of jobs/missions, own what seems like endless amounts of cars, planes, and other vehicles. you can have fun with your friends or just a public lobby. it is a grind, however. if you don't have much time to grind, or are not rich enough to buy shark cards than you might want a different online experience. if you are on pc, then expect a lot of modders. also expect a lot of tryhards in your lobby that will do nothing but try to kill you with an oppressor, which is a flying motorcycle with rockets, (i know, crazy). the game is also really confusing at first, but if you play it enough you will get it eventually.overall: this game is amazing. even with the online experience being bad sometimes, the story mode and most of the online is a great experence overall.",5,10,Good

"i give this a three stars because i don't know what rockstar was thinking when they made the online portion of this game. everything is extremely expensive and the shark cards are not worth it to buy. i feel like shark cards are just cash grabs instead of being a great way to get money for people who wants to spend their money on a video game to get in game items. also, the story is great, i'm glad they added the dlc to online instead of the story mode, but anyways love the game online missions and heist they're very fun to play, but sometimes they take hours to finish. one thing i feel like that need to be worked on for the next 2-3 years (until gta 6 comes out) is that you guys need to raise on how much money we earn on heist it's ridiculous that we have to earn that little bit of money just for us to spend it on something that is so expensive that it takes most of our money away. then we have to spend the next few hours to get that money back it's annoying and such a stupid process. the glitches is the only way to get a lot of money, which people been doing for the past few years. i love this game and can't wait for the next installment. thanks for reading this review and i hope rockstar don't make the same mistakes for online like they did with the gta 5 installment.",3,3,Normal

"this game has great charters like franklin but in the new dlc update, there are new vehicles online,  which hopes you have fun. ok, one thing i have to add is i'm a gta5 speedrunner and rockstar game the developer of the did one mistake, they sold a copy of an app to find modders on the game but hackers and find the code that rockstar game gave you so they would get you off if you are a regular player and you can play gta5 or if you played gta5 of a long time and you are high on your rp the hacker can take your 1349 rp to 1 and all of your stuff will be gone. if you read this what about you subscribe to tgg and the twitch and youtuber, darkviperau. and rockstar game if you get this i want you to understand your mistakes and hope you don't do the same in gta6 don't take it that i don't like the game i just don't like the modders or hackers. thanks to darkviperau and tgg for this message for you.",4,0,Good
"story mode - play through the entire story with 3 main characters , trevor , michael and franklin.each of them have their own stories and background but then eventually they meet up as a member.its interesting to see the game with 2 options with different outcomes when pulling off from the heist , so pretty self explanatory.the outcome may vary once you finish the game , i said its worth playing it again to enjoy the game.online mode - you do more than story mode , own an apartment , business , customize your character , more options than what story mode has to offer , etc. the only downside i can say about online mode is that , its hard to earn money as a beginner unless you have your buddy friend to play with , cause you will stuck in online mode not knowing how to earn money.but other than that , take your time cruise around ls to understand how to game actually works.",5,2,Good

"grand theft auto is a title that everyone knows. it’s the name of a series of games that helped define a generation, and in the 12 years since the third core game in the series helped push gaming into a larger spotlight.gaming has changed though. it’s been five years since gta iv burst onto the scene, and in that gap between major gta sequels, the genre has evolved. gta v proves that it has what it takes to not only still be relevant , but to take survival of the fittest to a new level. it’s the kind of game that knows it comes from an older generation. but instead of trying to recapture that youth, gta v instead runs with it and embraces that theme of old dogs staying true to form and celebrating what makes the franchise so damn popular in the first place.",5,6,Good
overall gta v is a great game. with high definition and smooth lighting unlike the previous gta iv. its a good game with hours of fun. great for modding too lol. the map is also very large vs the previous version and the cars are well designed (even though rockstar tries not to copy the exact design of the cars in reality). attention to detail is very high in this game from gun smoke to puddles after rain.,0,22,Bad

"honestly, this game has been out for 8 years and there are still so many bugs. i’ll brush up on some new ones, i’m not going to waste my time on the old ones because you clearly don’t read your reviews. cayo perico heist:1) you gather intel (and/or complete the heist setup) then come off or find a new lobby and the heist resets itself!? what a waste of time, it’s infuriating when you get worthless items. 2) three of us were doing the heist, maybe about an hour ago, we collected both key cards and the gate key. then the game glitches as i pick up the second key card and we lose one key card! we killed the whole compound to be sure but we had to restart the heist! what a waste of time!3) when we have to restart due to bugs etc one of the team will get kicked out no doubt. please don’t waste your time just restart the whole heist. 4) when you request you submarine it sometimes spawns on your helicopter (on land!). 5) the helicopter blows up so easy!? a bit of wind could kill the engine! on the other hand, when the structures and floor isn’t see-through it is aesthetically pleasing to look at.not a bad game, just need a lot of patience. also i have done the casino heist many, many times, but i cannot trade price for a casino car? because apparently i haven’t been a leader when i have? please sort your game out!",2,2,Bad
just for the single player alone 10 out of 10 only thing i ever wished for was a coop mode for campaign that would have made this game a lot better and if they added some single player dlc or something as for online i only wish that they include animals and make lobbies without flying bikes and stuff like that have like a hardcore lobby for people who want a more realistic experience but i guess people have been griefing long before they added flying bikes they had fighter jets which were almost worse in some ways so it’s something you have to deal with no matter what but there is a very enjoyable online component if you have a good group of friends. always make sure one or more people in your crew or friends group at least have a rocket bike or back to the future flying car with rockets so that the griefers leave you alone?,5,0,Good
"i honestly think it’s a good game. it’s quite realistic, fun to play, mess around, and overall have a good time with buddies. go alone, or team up, as there are also heists you can master with a friend or 3! it’s a good game, but to any parents reading this review because timmy wants the latest hit, timmy is a 6 year old, and this game contains: blood, drugs, heavy language, and fairly realistic violence. so please, if you’re concerned as to what the game contains, read above, and reconsider.",5,4,Good

"gta v online can be a very fun game to play with friends, and some of the jobs themselves are really good. however, rockstar has made it very clear that they will not put any effort into the a.i. of the game. the a.i. for civilians clearly was made to annoy players by turning into them when they are driving literally anywhere, and all-around being a literal nuisance, and enemy a.i. have been programmed to be very difficult. not like some other games that make the enemies difficult but fun to fight, but where, while they are in a helicopter, that is plummeting to the ground, they can shoot you in the head right before hitting the ground. i've played the game for a couple of years, and i still get annoyed when an enemy kills me in some amazingly impossible way.",3,0,Normal

"don’t bother with online. story mode is pristine and doesn’t require a year of playing for $100,000 like online. literally the story is the only thing worth playing i promise if you play online you’ll spend over 3/4 the time loading into lobbies and partying up with friends only to find glitches and sound defects all the time. story is really well done! all the characters are great in their own way. that’s the only reason this gets 5 stars",5,4,Good

i would recommend this because it has a very interesting and fun story line on story mode. online is fun as well because you can play with your friends and do heist and things like that. i do prefer the story mode because of the fact that you can switch between characters and they all have different personality's and that the missions are so different from each other. it very well thought through like all rockstars games are!!!,5,3,Good
"the single player of the game is pretty good in gameplay, but lacking many of the features that multiplayer can offer. after playing about 12 hours of multiplayer, i can't bring myself to do it anymore. to do pretty much anything that gets you any money to progress in the game, you rely on or go against other players.obviously, it is multiplayer and that's to be expected, but the amount of times i've had my experience ruined by a cheating player is absurd. you can't make any progress on multiplayer because all of you money is lost over and over because cheating players can simply kick you out of your vehicle that's needed for the missions, blow you up, teleport you or themselves across the map, instantly crash your game and countless other ways of making you fail. i've really tried to give it a chance but it's unplayable if your goal is to actually play the game as intended.to be honest, multiplayer is one of the main reasons i got this game and i'm regretting this purchase. unless you enjoy being teleported around and blown up randomly with little to no control over what happens in your gameplay experience, i wouldn't recommend this game for the multiplayer aspect.",1,15,Bad

"be able to create a lobby with friends and still be able to sell and do missions should be possible!!!spending more to waiting to load on a game or to transition from inside to out takes entirely tooooooooooi long. fix it!!!getting kicked timer is ba. tried to buy a shark card 3 times and keep getting kicked before i can complete transaction. traffic—when the shooting starts and traffic goes mad is ridiculous and i think it takes away from the realism of the game. bsget rid of to mail trucks. no one likes them and they ruin the game. getting shot in the head with a mg (machine gun) more than 1 time and to keep going is total bs. i’m sorry but i was a machine gunner in the usmc and that’s just impossible, so why don’t you make the weapon as powerful as it is suppose to be??!!!!!game would be great if you’d fix the problems!!  good game to play with the exception of vehicles and doing missions. i think the flying bikes, cars etc (unrealistic) should not be allowed to interfere with people doing missions in slow vans, blimps,helicopters, and cargo trucks. it really gives them a seriously unfair advantage don’t ya think???they should only be used for fun only!!!",2,5,Bad
it’s a great game. it does glitch sometimes and does take a while to load but it’s a big map. if you are too impatient to load in then delete the game but if you’re patient and load into the game you can have so much fun. however i can’t talk for everyone but i think quite of people have fun. it’s an older game but it’s one of the best in my opinion. if you try just be patient. i hope you enjoy your time playing the game.,5,0,Good

my review on this game is do not buy it.. the online version first takes sometimes 30 min to get on a server with your friends once you finally get on a server within the first 30 minutes of play and doing your missions a modder/hacker will come on and either kick everyone on server or mess up you missions. then once you are kicked another up to 30 minutes to join your friends again to have it happen again. if you like to keep loading and actually not play the game yes go ahead and buy.. oh and don't expect rockstar games to actually fix the problem.. lol they got there money don't care if you actually get to play fairly or even play the game.  i would consider checking to make sure that rockstar doesn't make the game that you buy if you intend on playing a fun game. happy gaming :),0,7,Bad
gta 5 is very good game story mode and online the only downside is when you try to get clothes or even a new haircut or tattoo you cant get destroyed by an oppresor or attack helicopter or any  vehicle that has weapons or missiles by youtubers like xpertthief and other lmao but luckily they have passive mode or you can just  drive to paleto bay for some alone time but i think it is a good game overrall no doubt about that so far is have been playing gta 5 for about 5 years so far and its about to hit 6,0,7,Bad
"enhanced graphics? from ps3 to ps4 i believe that there was a slight enhance to the graphics as it is.i’ll be honest, gta 5 is just not worth the time anymore maybe they should have just came with gta6. especially for those who have played since 2013, 9 years later you would of thought for things to be different.gta online - the traffic can’t drive and always crash into you- the movement of your character is slow and    sluggish - you have to always wait real time up to 5 minutes for certain requests such as your carr being delivered, passive mode ect- you have all these contacts in your phone that are so pointless because you can’t call most of them",2,0,Bad

i played this game online long enough to give it one star.where do i start1. people think they are better than you no matter how much money or amount of cars or weapons they got2. the oppressor mk2 will always be on you.3. people shoot you for no reason and all you hear is kids screamingand shouting on their headsets and people are not even english they speak other languages.4. americans mostly play this game so if you want to arrange a heist all you will get are randoms if one person fails a heist they blame it all on you and leave the heist leaving you angry and upset with all your hard work worth nothing.also since there are many timezones it is a headache to get people to join your heist to suit their timezone.5. grinding and running businesses is so tiring and repetitive you have to do it to make ends meet.and many many more problems and things are negative about this game.,1,15,Bad
"this game truly stands out! with over 100+ hours of content, this game is still enjoyable!i’m not too much of a gta online fan, but it has its benefits. i mostly enjoy story mode the most and i believe you should not only play a rockstar game, just for the multiplayer. well, that’s my opinion. i usually like to play the single player first, before i spoil myself with online.anyways that’s my opinion on the game! what’s yours??",5,0,Good
"gta 5 has a great story mode, and the missions are always fun to play. i really like that you can find random events all around ls, and that you can have more story mode with the strangers and freaks missions, this stuff makes the game never get old. over all, the game is very enjoyable! i recommend buying it immediatly.?",5,0,Good

"this is a really nice game, you can basically do anything you want. you get cars, planes, motor bikes. almost anything. you earn money by hiests and uber driving. you can steel peoples cars as well. you can turn cops on and off but i recommend you turn it on simply because it is more fun that way. personally i found it a lot, a killed many people and stole many cars. if you want to make a hiest you can earn more that 4 million which will get you a lot of profit so you can upgrade ur house and get better cars and you proggres as you go. this is an amazing game and its really fun and never really gets boring.",4,2,Good
gta  is one of the best things i played because robing banks gives you a lot of money. another reason is because all of the guns but when i was playing gta 5 online the stun gun was gone and the atomizer was too expensive!!! the second to last  thing is that you i don’t know how to get money out of the bank. the best thing is cars and police chases but overall gta 5 is the best game ever!!! so everyone should get gta 5!?,5,0,Good
"the game has really good graphics and cars from real life. during the weekly update in gta online on november 9 to 17, it says you can get 1,000,000 dollars and to get it you have to claim the money in between november 18th to 25th, which they never gave me! i only play when there's more weaponized vehicles instead of the rhino and attack buzzard helicopter on story mode. the vehicles i like in gta online are the  insurgent pickup custom, moc ( mobile operation center), apc, and the armored kuruma.?",4,0,Good
amazing game i really love how rockstar mad the main characters resemble their actors i also love the way the physics are true to real life like the breaking of car axels after a jump or the fact that headshots actually kill the enemies unlike battle royal games *cough cough* fortnite. and i like the aspect where they wake up in different clothes every time i log in to the game i just started playing like 1 month ago and i love the game cant wait for the 6th one!?,5,0,Good
"story mode is pretty good in my opinion, but online mode is a total mess. the jobs and vehicles you added are insignificant and should be changed. many peoples problems are how solo playing in online is very hard and making money solo is doable, but very slow. secondly, the vehicles you added like the oppressor mk 2 is very broken due to how fast it is and the amount of missiles it can shoot. i have heard you nerfed it, but it is still op and can have people shoot out others cargo which is hours of work of that one persons cargo all to waste. in conclusion, its a good game before, but the updates rolled in and the game became more for the people who play it more than newcomers. all in all, it forces newcomers to pay for your expensive shark cards that costs too much and give a bit too little from the purchases you can make in gta online",3,2,Normal

"the story is lackluster in its writing. meanwhile the gameplay did not age well since 2013. i got this game day one back then, and while it was enjoyable initially, even back then i was disappointed by the crummy story and lack of side content. the end game; non-existent. the best part about the main game is the performances from the main cast. they are a blast to watch & play with. weapon selection is limited, and money in this game is also very limited until after the story ends. i get the idea, but even in the red dead series--in which there's less money in theory--there's a sense of progression. meanwhile gta online, the only reason why the game can still be $60 and get a re-release for each console generations, is abysmal. i played it in the early years, and it was rough and generally not worthwhile. after taking a break from it then returning, i've soon discovered that it's more of the same toxic game design with a new coat of paint. the cayo perico heist is supposed to be this game mode that evolves the franchise, gameplay, and story of gta online, but i believe nothing really changed. it leans heavily on purposely davatoged gameplay that influences the player to either rage quit or buy into microtransactions. i'm surprised it's lasted this long. and i don't think gta as a series is going to get better. it peaked at gta4 and it's dlc.in the end gta 5 and gta online both feel like a bad drug habit. they're tempting at first but the allure fades away fast and gets worse with time.?",2,0,Bad

the game is still enjoyable after all of these years i have complaints with it mostly with the main story mode since i don't like multiplayer because i don't like playing online games the story now feels kinda bland even if i and many others still love the game's story and characters it deserves an update of sorts or some form of new content to spice the game up cause once you beat the main story or 100% the game there's nothing left to do some sort of dlc that adds a new campaign to story mode would liven things up like with the two new story campaigns in gta 4 adding new guns and cars to single player even if it's just from online mode would spice things up if not then creating a new game all together improving and updating mechanics would be a huge improvement as well but realistically it'll never happen because of how much rockstar likes to beat the game's corps and add only to multiplayer but it would also fix other issues i have with the game as well such as the fact that you can't get away with anything and the police will be on you the moment you even think about doing something beat up a dude in a fist fight get swarmed by police shooting at you it gets more annoying because this is practically every time and with the massive penalty loosing money whenever you get caught or getting killed even on accident like falling off a building or getting run over you'll receive a it's not a fun mechanic even if that's how it's always been especially because getting money is a pain to do since there's no good way to earn big chunks of money after the game ends the stock market is random 90% of the time and barely gives a payout why not have repeatable heists that the player can go on also adding more to the heist partners too since the gimmick of them improving after every job becomes irrelevant since most of the time picking a low experienced member will cause them to die or get arrested i'd also like to see more enemies to fight like in watchdogs 2 where there's various gang factions that own terratory with items like money or clothing you can steal from there is something like that already but they barely factor into the game at all?,3,0,Normal

it is the best game i hv ever played. since it was released in 2013 i m still finding fun in playing it. because of its real world like features i lv playing it. i wnt to thnks rockster for this. now jst waitin for gta 6:beaming_face_with_smiling_eyes:,5,2,Good
from the recent account  wipe of what i heard 70% of player i don’t think rockstar really know what damage they just caused them selves there’s people with 7 year old accounts and loyal players to the game but now because such a big business is unable to do make a game so so easy to find a glitch in who’s fault is it really ours for exploiting the glitch and helping the business get better or our fault that we as a community found a easy way to get money so we didn’t need to grind the game 12 hours a day 7 days a week just to get a bloody apartment or a business to start at so i’m sorry rockstar that you were willing to lose thousands possibly hundreds of thousands of once loyal players because we all decided to give up grinding the game for a car that had a parachute on the roof or a jet so you had a small chance of surviving from the office to the casino or where ever else end of the day we found our way of getting a fun experience of a game whilst it lasted and i hope your happy that sooo many people left to play other games cos people can’t be bothered anymore with grinding (my account got wiped as well surprise surprise),1,13,Bad
"i think if u felt anything lacking in previous gta games , this one fills it all with  one hell of an open world experience . three protagonists  which are very different from each other and live different live are brought together to go one hell of a ride filled with chaos. still one of the best games out there even after  8 years  of its release.?",5,0,Good
"this is handsdown the most frustrating game i have ever played, the main storyline is alot of fun but once i beat that i began online... online is easily the worst setup to an online game ever! missions take forever to load and crash constantly. i thought i was finally getting the hang of it but i was wrong. and if the game constantly crashing and being unbelievably hard isnt agrivating enough lets let the other online players bomb you aswell, i cant drive three seconds down the road without someone flying overhead and dropping a bomb on my car! random people set bounties on me for some stupid reason so im being hunted down by everyone that just so happens to drive by!!!",1,6,Bad
"this was a fun game but i highly l recommend not to lets kind 13 play this.it isn't very  really for kids under the age of 13 there are swear words inappropriate content and violence.i recommend roblox or minecraft.i know most of you must be thinking ""robox isn't that family friendly kids should't be playing that."" well when creating a roblox account you have to put n your birthday and whenever yo or your child puts in their birthday it knows how old they are and as you play over the years it will relies if your older.on roblox there are restricted age policy so if you child or yourself is under the age limit of the game you can't join.if you you want to stay extra safe children under 10 should not play roblox.minecraft is fine for all ages even 32 year old men/women.?",5,0,Good

one of the best games in the gta series easliy after gta sa but they have taken gta online too freaking far... the time and money rockstar gave to develop gta online... they should have put in that affort on gta 6 or any other game... but the singleplayer is just phenomenal.... any fun activities to do good story and even being a 2013 game it still beats many modern era games?,5,0,Good
dude this game is one of my favorite games gta 5 it's been out since 2013 and i had this game for 8 years it is a good game i got it on my birthday i was either 4 or 5 years old and i loved it it looked so realistic i love it and i still play and i looks new like literally it looks like it came out this year i even loved the year 2013 it was my favorite year i could do anything i want i loooveeee it i will keep playing this game until i am a teenager i love rockstar games. thank you rockstar games we love you:).?,5,0,Good
"to be honest, i've played this game so much that i know the gta v map better than my hometown. and the storyline is incredible. so good that i've played the story multiple times and i've lost count. rockstar did an amazing job with the game. can't wait for gta 6. thanks rockstar!?",5,0,Good
the game is a must play.the storyline was intresting. better than gta iv or any other gta except sa. controls were easy but flying a plane is not good. and driving cars is easy and fun. chracters are great. there is no good main villain at the end. all are like weak. graphics are awesome in 4k uhd. so please buy and play it(if you have not). just because of controls of plane and villains i have removed 1 :glowing_star:,4,3,Good
gta v is one of my favorite games. unfortunately the mass amount of children playing make it nearly impossible to do anything online worthwhile. want to play a heist? spend 30 minutes gathering 3 people only to have some angry kid quit mid game or they just arent good. want to play a mission. spend an hour setting up for one game because some impaitent kid joins and leaves within 60 seconds becauae the match isnt ready. they are ruining the experience. no its already ruined,0,2,Bad
"best way to desrcibe it.. greatest game that sucks a**. it's all great untill you get stuck in the space clouds online and freezes or when it kicks you from a match making session 4 out of 5 times.. trust me. it ain't my internet... seriously need to fix the bugs and make it more efficient. and c'mon. almost 2 million for a rc car(bandito)?? lol be reasonable.. unless you're a hacker, 2 mill ain't easy to acquire..",0,6,Bad

i like this game because of gran theft auto  v premium edition witch mostly the game gives u 100k cash for gran theft auto online and its mostly a first person aka like real life game with it gives the info of los angeles/los santos lots of good music for the cars like -rap-mexican and more and i give it a 5 star because its a very good game and i don care what other people say it still a good game!and also why steam took gran theft auto 5 off the app i got a steam card so i thought i can buy gran theft auto  v until it was an´t there so i just bought gran theft auto iv?,5,0,Good
"now many people are not allowing their kids to get this game , which i absolutely understand. now of course i would not at all recommend this game for someone under the age of 13 , with being said i understand why a parent would not allow their kid to get this game , because yes their is some nudity and on one part of story mode ur forced to go into a strip club but their is nothing bad happening and , if u have a smart enough kid they will walk out not doing anything. also if u make the right decisions in this game nothing bad will happen. but i am 19 but i still have not yet seen anything too bad and i have been playing this game nonstop for the last year and i haven’t seen anything.",0,8,Bad
"the creators haven't even though about a bad language filter. i would love to do more gta5 videos on my youtube but they take about 5 days to edit one! this is due to either i have no sound effects or i have sound effects but there is loads of bad language. the phone is unrealistic. you have to use a cursor which is shaped like a middle finger. please just have a dot. not only the charters swear like every 5 secs, there are builboards around the city with have form of inappropriate content like language and fingers. the 'sandbox mode' sucks! there's a limit to how many things to place, you can only place them in certain areas. this game is full of swearing. more than every other game i played",1,5,Bad
it's a good game and the story mode is amazing but gta online is another story. the game is filled with hackers. from putting a cage on me and blowing me up to firing explosive bullets on a juggernaut bunker mission. it's a big problem. they have control of most of the server and can do almost anything and even kick me out of the server and into story mode. playing bunker series missions are hard for me as i will likely get a hacker. but apart from the bunker series i really don't find them on other missions. only on bunker series and servers.?,3,0,Normal

"this game looked fun and i'm sure it is, but it just wouldn't work. i got this game on the epic games launcher, and when i first opened it i had some errors downloading the rockstar launcher. it wasn't too major, and i figured it out after about 5 minutes. afterwards, i had to make a rockstar social club account, but it wouldn't let me make one and said i was offline.  i tried several times relaunching the game and after about the 4th i gave up and just made one through their website. i'd wasted about 20 minutes at this point and it took around an hour to download the game, so i was getting pretty frustrated. after i finally made a rockstar social club account the game said i needed to verify my email. however, i waited around 7 minutes and the email never showed up. i tried everything, checking the spam folder, resending multiple times, looking at forums, but nothing seemed to work. like i said, this game looks fun, but it's wasted so much of my time and it's filled with errors.",1,5,Bad
this game is the no. 1 game of all times even after completing it's 8 years today and moreover it is a masterpiece of rockstar games and none of the gamers can live without playing this game. this is an amazing open world game which provides you a great realistic experience along with a large map to explore.  happy  birthday  gta  5 !!!!!!?,5,0,Good

i’ve played over a 1000 hours on this game and it is super fun. i love every aspect of the game except their loading times which they quote on quote fixed. i still takes forvever to load into things and even in free mode when i try to enter my garage or call in my rc car it can take up to 10 minutes. the loading times are still atrocious.?,4,0,Good
"its good concept of a game. graphics are good, story lines are good and there's so much to do so there's no getting bored.however, one thing that really annoys me is the controls. when driving fast on a mission and you slightly hit something along the way the car drastically spirals out of control and you either end up in a ditch or upside down which in returns means you haven't got enough time to complete the mission and you fail..another thing is the flying ...when flying a plane or helicopter its the worst controls..  you want to turn left and the whole plane flips on its side.. its the worst controls .",4,3,Good
i would be happy to never see gta5 ever again this game is now almost a decade old and has been released like 5 times for full price. honestly if you look up beating a dead horse in the dictionary i'm positive you would find a rockstar logo and gta5. update i read today they are releasing it again on a new console. good god i'm done with rockstar games?,1,0,Bad
even after 8  years this game is in top trending but i really hope that rockstar releases gta 6. it's like gta 5 is a game that we ever wanted now also buying this game is all worth it means no one would ever say that i bought this game called gta 5 and it was a total disaster. this is the best game i've played in my whole life?,5,0,Good

don’t know how they could make the game so bad with all this bs. every time they make me play the prologue before i can go online. it such bs. i beat the story mode years ago and have no interest. i regret buying this game. it seems every aspect of this game has become to sell you shark cards online. as soon as you get into it you will run out of money and be tempted to pay rockstar more. it seems to be designed for this. it’s hard to make money and too easy to spend. you can’t even sell the real estate you previously bought leaving you feeling frustrated wasting your time. don’t waste your time. could of been a great game but their greed has ruined their masterpiece.,1,7,Bad

worst game i’ve ever played. the game has so many ridiculous bugs and i can never just get on and play a heist that i worked my balls off to get setup because some stupid bug happens and then my friend can’t join and we have to restart our games. the loading time is insane and a great majority of the missions are the dumbest things i’ve ever witnessed. plus the game has been out for 10 years and they just decided to not fix any bugs. they honestly probably added more. don’t buy this game it’s honestly the worst game i’ve ever played.,1,0,Bad

everyone's heard of this game and everyone knows how good it is. it's one of the first game's to be a more violent game than other one's and i think that's why people hate it so much. being able to just crash around having free roam of a city and doing what you want is so great.,5,2,Good

honestly. game was great til casino. the gambling is dumb. you pick events on horse. you lose. but pick another horse and that evens horse wins the next one. slots youvnever make more than what you bet on. it's always laggy. and its not the internet if i have 400mbs. 2 stars might even be pushing it. and make the cars that you push so hard for ads and everything else to be any type of relevancy to the game. let's hope the next one can be remotley good.,2,3,Bad

"terrible online mode with extremely long loading times, money making methods and features that force players to play in public sessions in which most of the time there will be high level players or modders that will kill you for no reason. you’d expect a game that has gained over a billion in revenue to be able to adjust the game to accommodate pc gamers for a better ux but they’ve went the cheaper route readjusting key bindings, so it’s basically still a console game but using a keyboard and mouse... you can imagine having to use arrow keys in menus and pressing enter to confirm every single action rather than just clicking.",1,3,Bad

there never seems to be a clear explanation of when there will be a cut scene or when you need to do something in the game. countless failed missions because of this. controls are wonky at best especially while swimming or flying. the game has a good story and like able characters but the execution is sloppy.  countless perks to play online- often advertising as “free” items. playing on psplus is not free and therefore these items are not free either. that is a trap if i’ve ever seen one.here’s hoping the following is better executed.,2,0,Bad
gta v online is the worst. i was in a lobby with a modder and they weren't being obnoxious like constantly killing me and other stuff but they did raise my rank and give me a ton of money that i didn't ask for. yet rockstar banned me for 30 days and reset my account. rockstar is a terrible company that treats their players like trash. i am very upset that we aren't even allowed to make an appeal. im never play gta v online again. rockstar is just in it for money and are just milking a dead game.,1,2,Bad

honestly this is such a great game with so much potential but there is so many bugs that just make this game so frustrating to play. every few minutes connection is lost and i’m constantly getting kicked out of my game. it takes forever for people to join heists as you need 4 people (which is a pain in the ass) when you can do it with 2. it’s even more annoying when you’ve nearly finished a mission and some idiot decides to leave and you have to restart the whole thing and find new people aswell.,1,3,Bad

good but they haven’t changed anything or added the good things from gta 4. spent like an hour swimming around cayo island tapping a just to find multiple ways up but the character physically just gives up and falls backwards making it even more frustrating plus nobody is nice to eachother just regular interaction is usually abuse and there’s no option to do stuff alone and none of the ways that make money make sense with how expensive things are unless you wanted to play the same game for like a decade?,3,0,Normal
so why i gave this a 1 star. is because i was selling weapons from my bunker when an oppresor mk 2 just blew up the trailer and you know how annoying that is. there either needs to be a punishment for cargo griefing or make it so you cant kill people if they are selling or delivering cargo. (what i mean by punishment is like a ban and ot gets higher and higher evrey time you just kill to much cargo and dont mind my spelling im on a phone typing this i play the game on xbox,1,2,Bad

good game. but i'm getting tired of having to restard the game because of infinite loading screens. somedays i can go online on gta and get stuck in a black loading screen making me alt + f4 out. this has happened many many times. and over the time i've played the game i haven't seen much improvement.,3,0,Normal

it’s a pay to win game. the online lobbies are horrendous due to the unfairness. for example when new players first join online and try to complete missions to make money there is a 70% chance of a higher level player flying in with a helicopter and firing missiles at you. the only way to fight back is to get purchase it from the store and that is why the game is okay to win. story is decent.,1,0,Bad

the online version of this video game is horrible.. the likeliness to die in missions is unreal. creators can’t ensure difficulty so they force spawn cpu’s to kill you. spawn you in front of deadly choppers and other dumb things of that sort. also glitching in missions is a problem. literally could go on and on about the make of this game. really hope the creators and editors do a better job next go around.?,1,0,Bad

they give you no warning and completely reset your online account because of using defects in their own game. maybe fix it instead of going after people who are just trying to have fun. you make it so difficult to obtain an amount of money that you can actually have fun with (unless you buy it). i have played on this account since the game came out on 360 and i get an account reset for doing one glitch. pathetic.,1,6,Bad

way too old of a game to still be having glitches some of which have been around for a year. u can find a secret room and they patch it sooon as there’s an update but then u got god mode players that’s been around for a year already it’s honestly ridiculous u can’t enjoy the game doesn’t even matter what u have these type of players ruin the game literally stopped playing it and might not even play 6 they taking way to long to do anything and it’s already hard enough n stressful to grind and make money as it is.?,2,0,Bad

this newer update for xbox only has ruined the game! you cannot sell your bunker or businesses without getting blown up by oppressor mk ii’s! you can’t make a solo public anymore... and the solo public and invite only tab (which is an option when you’re in story mode) you cannot sell your businesses because some activities are limited! it’s truest disappointing to see such a good game fall heavy!,1,0,Bad
"gta v is a great game with improved gameplay, well designed map, interesting action packed missions and performances of the three protagonists, but lacks a well character development, physics, some effects and storyline. the storyline of the game is b-grade and copied some missions from other gta games and it's game length is shorter than other games, unlike gta iv's gritty and breathtaking story. if u are a tom cruise fan, then this game is for youin my opinion, i'm giving a rating of 4 out of 5 stars.?",4,0,Good
this game is the worst game i have ever played it would be better if everything wasnt so expensive or if money was easier to get not to mention how you can't play online servers without at least 3 oppressor mark 2 users making it impossible to go outside speaking of online why can i only play in a server for 30 minutes when i'm in an online server for 30 minutes i get kicked but it takes 20 minutes just  to get into a server i could go on with what's bad about this game but then it would be a 5000 page novel so i'll end the review here,1,0,Bad

online is the worst feature about the game. the loading screens and players that aren’t able to complete simples tasks like driving away from shooting ai’s. this game is pretty good when it comes to story mode but online is a poor excuse for a game. they shouldn’t make a six if it’s gonna be anywhere near as bad as five. rockstar maybe should try this time instead of making a failure.,0,3,Bad

not even one starone thing i hate of this game is every black people are the nices but all the white people are not and they is a lot of sexes jokes that are kids are useing right now.if you are a mom or a dad i will not let kids play this game.and if you dont make gta 6 with no bad jokes and please make no black jokes because of the black lives matter and it dose not help. kids will think this is how games work and it is not please no more black jokes?,1,0,Bad
i have completed the game around 6 times and the campaign it’s self is around 15 hours long no break. the game is well optimised and it’s a amazing game in general with it’s amazing voice actors and the secrets you get to discover from the game. 5/5 stars recommend it?,5,0,Good
it’s a really fun game online and everything don’t get me wrong i love playing gta but there are too many overpowered vehicles in the game and they are way overpriced and it ruins its. i found a truck off the street and spent crazy money on it upgrading it and then i put it in my garage well i take it out of my garage and start driving it then a jet comes up and blows my car up well sense i found it off the street and didn’t buy it i lost that car for good all the money i spent upgrading that car i put it in my garage and replaced a car out of that just to store it so i lost my other car and all that money i spent upgrading it just to get blow up by a jet. i think that’s dumb in my opinion.?,3,0,Normal
"love the story and the online is fun with friends but the way businesses work and how much of a waste of money goods are as well as the amount of horrible social encounters is absolutely disgusting. wasted credits trying to make a business only to be harassed by griefers in most every lobby only to never make a profit or enough to begin to. complete waste of time and money, so don’t even buy this game unless all you want to do is monopolize on being a troll.?",2,0,Bad

used to be great. ive been playing for years and the content gets better but its flawed as you have to spend your hard earned cash just to stay up to date on a game. earning gta buck is even tricker and longer this is why people get frustrated and spend their money. i'm not being fooled anymore. id like my account deleted,1,0,Bad
this game has  good record of money and after 9 years it also have record of money :money_bag::money_bag: the main reason i give it  4 stars because in the ending franklin is bad if he choose to kill michael or trevor but if we choose the c deathwish he is good btw rockstar don't make female character for girls but this game is very good than other gta games?,4,0,Good
it is the most stress relieving game you will ever find and if you just want to goof around and have fun it can be the perfect game to do that as well.over all i give it five stars because rockstar did an amazing job on this game?,5,0,Good
i think this game gta 5 online is a joke beware players i bought shark cards off them and bought expensive cars and they made two of my cars disappear and now they cant even verify that i even owned them so pretty much they are gone for ever so pretty much u spend your money into this video game and then things going missing so it's pretty much a pointless game u work hard for things and they steal them and make them dissapear game is a joke dont spend your money on shark cards and trying to buy there cars theyll disappear and they won't do nothing about it game is a joke i had the rsx fully modified now its goneee thank you rockstar you are such a joke!!!!,1,0,Bad

were do i start. pay to win. retarded controls. mpc with laser accuracy. time grind constantly. cancer community. literally pointless to play if you dont have 4+hrs of freetime. and they do everything they can to provoke you to spend your money on ingame currency that if you spend $50 will last you one purchase. but hey the games fun if you can look past all this bs,1,0,Bad

i will give 4 stars if they would fix their servers for online but it's sxxxxxxit for all 7 years of playing that game and rdr2 even worse since they released beta version keep dropping me off and freezing over marketing nothing more . in general good game but rockstar don't try online version if you don't want to spend enough money for extra servers making bilions for the game launch  in the first few weeks .?,2,0,Bad

right well for one rockstar games don’t make playing with your friends online easy to do as you have to go through about 5 different stages and whenever the occasion you do get into a game with friends one of them gets kicked after about 5 minutes. new heist is good tried to play it with my friend but we kept getting kicked from the game as the rockstar servers are dogsh*t. all said and done,2,0,Bad

can’t do missions without being shot by other random players so it is extremely difficult to make money in the game because high level players just kill lower leveled players that are helpless and are trying to make money but they can’t due to  being constantly killed which is something i would like changed or something to make lower leveled player a chance to complete their missions without higher leveled players killing them almost always. it’s still a good game but that’s really annoying.,4,3,Good

so i will admit i do enjoy the game i do enjoy the missions (minus the one we’re you torture a guy) and i love to muck around in the story mode but one thing i hate one detail in the game and as far as i can tell beyond googling it i had no context on this effectively if anyone looks at online videos of the game you might see a weapon called the rail gun and will want it and any mission searching will show that you unlock it after the mission ‘minor turbulence’ and in game it dos say you can go down in a submarine to go get it but going down there you will find everything is there but the rail gun and the only way to get it is by apparently being a retuning player from the ps3/xbox360 version of the game log into it and after doing the same mission then you can get itagain i do like this game but that one bit has annoyed me?,4,0,Good
"horrible online play always has laggy people in sessions, people cheating, lobby’s always say everyone in the entire session left and boots you offline when i know it’s not my internet cause every other game plays completely fine. this game is just straight trash anymore after gta 4. don’t recommend at all waste of money!",1,2,Bad

online: it is terrible. i have gotten to the point where i have an office and a cargo warehouse. i got a deal to get an exclusive watch for 30k which would sell much much more. i was about to collect the cargo when the game unlaunched and kicked me out of the session. i have just wasted 30k money when i could have gotten 70k+. this game is terrible. it also takes very long to load the game.,0,2,Bad
its a 2022 reveiw of the game so dont get me wrong first of all talking about the good stuff of the game is that there are alot of mods to enjoy with the heist missions are fun to play the gameplay is decent for now the the exploration and things like cop chases and killing npc is fun now talking about the cons the story is little to average and some missions are unrelastic and repetitive like always killing agents and cops the graphics now look good but outdated i am only talking about singleplayer camping and after the game there is nothing more much to do and there are dlc for online only not for offline and there are few stuff that were in the previous installments but not in this one so 3 out of 5   and we need gat 6not gta 5 improved and inhanced so please stop rockstar?,3,0,Normal

gta 5 is by far the best video game i have ever played i have yet to get sick of it the story mode would be a little better if all players could be active at one time like if it was a 3 player game the online mode is very good if you want to have fun with your friends in a private game mode otherwise you will just get killed over and over that's is when the game get boring but still there is so much to do in that game you can't really get bored of and that is why gta is by far the best game?,5,0,Good

i think players who just hang out in lobbies and kill everyone.  bad players should be excluded from playing with good players who want to play the game. every time i get to the end of a mission they are there waiting to kill me. i respawns in the same spot they killed me and dont have my weapon equipped any more and they just kill me over and over until i leave the lobby?,5,0,Good

"gta online was my favorite thing to play almost literally every day, through 2 consoles and 6 years. then rockstar decided that was enough when they decided to add the oppressor mk2. i'll guarantee 19 of 20 online players would say that addition was the undoing of the greatness that effectively was gta5 online.",0,3,Bad
"full of bugs, and overpowered expensive vehicles that can only be earned through purchasing shark cards or cheating, since there is no way to legitimately get money due to ridiculous load times on all missions, and aforementioned vehicles killing you every other second in free roam. completely ruined the already extremely glitchy and slow game?",1,0,Bad
this game is much better than pubg or fortnite because it has more logical meanings and more exciting graphics :winking_face: also we can play it online as well as offline we can also play freestylei liked this game very much ...... yeepeeeee. :grinning_face_with_big_eyes:?,5,0,Good

why's there no efforts put on banning or punishing the grievers in a more strict way? the game just adds on to your frustration when the sole purpose of it should be clearing your mind and stay happy. some players make it downright difficult. rockstar should do something to tackle such ones.?,1,0,Bad

"my experience with this game was very satisfying, this game is based on real- life graphics and when we install mods in this game then the game becomes more amazing to play but i am giving the game 4 star rating because gta iv is more realistic than gta v because, the physics of gta iv is more realistic than gta v though gta iv is older than gta v but rockstar games is making more efforts on gta vi. i am patiently waiting for the new gta vi.?",4,0,Good

"overall a good game even after so long, i recommend you play online sometime and try and get used to it, it's kind of hard to make money but it will start to be easy trust me, it's such a good game i rate it 10/10, one bad thing is that there is a lot of modders, and a lot of glitches like the rp glitch right now and another infinite chip glitch in casino.?",4,0,Good

story mode is very good but online is just terrible now everything is overpriced and you get paid so little for doing jobs. it’s like rockstar are forcing you to buy shark cards to actually get anything in the game. it’s just a cash grab at this point. they’re worse than ea.?,1,0,Bad

if you guys are going to update the game so much you guys should add it so you can go back to the place where you start at in the campaign. and you should add a giant island on the map with a little town and people and a couple of odd jobs there i think it would be really cool and you would get a hole bunch player's to come back to the game.,0,2,Bad
so sick of losing money because your game glitches just lost another 725000 i’ve already stopped using the bunker because get ripped off on deliveries don’t use the farms anymore because of the same reason so if you can’t use even the warehouse without getting ripped off what’s left maybe should just stop playing this game and bring all my friends with me?,1,0,Bad

story mode is easily beatable and not extremely long with no dlc in past 15 years and the online version is so garbage because every 10 to 20 minutes you either get separated from the rest of the lobby and put in your own or they just kick you outright making it impossible to complete sell missions or heists with how disgustingly bad the servers are.?,2,0,Bad

"Game is kind of buggy compared to ps3 version. Airplane missions for Trevor stop producing money after 5 or 6 times. Also, game is significantly easier in a lot of small ways. Eg, buried tires at Trevor's airfield are lower, making the buggy missions easier so you don't get high-centered with the buggy. Makes the game less challenging and more boring. Also, the helos give up too easy. More fun to have to shoot them down in order to complete a mission. Starter version.",3,1,Normal

"SPOILERS!Grand Theft Auto is one of the definitive, if not the definitive, open-world/sandbox game series. The game is notable for the freedom that it allows the player, from minor activities such as playing golf to major activities such as evading not only the cops, but also the military in high-speed chases. Despite this level of freedom in the game, the series is also notable for having a very enjoyable main storyline, because of both the fun gameplay and characters. While I have played various parts of various GTA games (mostly Liberty City Stories and San Andreas), the only game that I’ve completed (and put over 120 hours into, no less) is the latest game, GTA V. Some people prefer other games in the series, but even with that comparison, it is a great game. Aside from having a sh*t ton of stuff to do, there is the engaging storyline, which I absolutely love. I think that because the game didn’t take itself as seriously as other games in the series, I could enjoy it more, especially with Trevor’s character. The gameplay mechanics, especially the combat (mainly shooting and getting into cover) were also vastly improved from the previous installments. So, without further ado, here is my personal list of my favorite GTA V missions.NOTE: I’m excluding Strangers and Freaks’ missions, so don’t expect any Grass Roots or Rampage missions here (although both of those mission types are awesome nonetheless).#10: The Multi-Target AssassinationThe reason that I love this mission so much is because of how quick it is and how it makes you feel very tense, like how even the smallest mistake could ruin it all. This mission is the second Lester Assassination mission, where you must snipe four different targets, all within a time limit. There’s just something great about driving my motorcycle, getting off, sniping the target, and then quickly traveling to the next one. The time limit is also very lenient, so while it did make me feel tense, it wasn’t frustrating. This is a very simple mission, especially with regards to characterization, but it was so fun.#9: The Wrap UpThe opening alone made this worth a mention on this list, as it involves several people pulling guns on each other in a hilarious scene; you have Michael and Davey on one team, Agent Haines by himself, Haines’ partner (Agent Sanchez, who turned out to be a double agent) working with the FIB, the IAA, and even Merryweather. Haines ends up escaping on his own, but Davey and Michael are being quickly overwhelmed, so who swoops in with his sniper to save the day? Trevor! This is awesome because one, Michael and him were not on good terms, so it is cool to see him save the day (predictable, maybe, but still cool); and two, who doesn’t love switching back-and-forth between Michael, who is on the ground taking enemies head on, and Trevor, who is providing cover fire for Michael? Plus, sniping helicopter pilots is always fun, so this mission is a keeper for me.#8: Lamar DownThis mission is great for two simple reasons: firstly, Lamar is a hilarious character – his wannabe gangster attitude is a perfect foil for Franklin’s logical reasoning- and secondly, you also get to multiple ways to confront the situation, just like the last mission. The difference, however, is that you now get two men on the ground (Franklin and Trevor), and get to snipe as Michael. This works out well because Michael’s special ability makes sniping a breeze and Trevor’s rage mode makes gunning down enemies a blast. While Franklin doesn’t have any on-foot special abilities, his determination to save his friend makes this mission, especially towards the end when he is driving him home, have some great character interaction. This is the first of three missions I’ve included that involve all three characters as part of the gameplay, and those are always amazing missions in my book.#7: Fresh MeatDuring the ending of the amazing Bury the Hatchet mission, Michael is captured by Trevor’s competitors, falsely believing that he is his lover and will come to save him. Since Trevor and Michael aren’t on speaking terms, it is up to Franklin and Lester to save the day. Lester helps Franklin find where they are keeping him and thus begins a shootout to save Michael. Most of my favorite missions involve simple shootouts, but I love the simplicity of GTA’s combat; you slide in cover, you pop out every now and then to clip down some guys, and then you move on to the next area. Once you reach Michael, you can freely swap between them and take out your enemies while trying to escape. I think this mission, along with Lamar Down, helps to solidify his status as a trusting and loyal member of the team (which Trevor would be, too, if he wasn’t a psychopath), which I liked (and why I hated the two alternate endings in the game). A simple shootout with two characters is why this mission is great in my eyes.#6: Blitz PlayBlitz Play is just a full-on assault mission where you have Franklin and Michael in cover, shooting officers as you wait for your opening to escape, while Trevor is perched up high with his RPG and sniper, providing cover. Again, the premise is very simple, but I love switching between all the characters. If I want to try to get as many headshots as possible, Michael is my guy, but when I want to blow up cars to help eliminate large groups of enemy, I’m going to Trevor. Franklin doesn’t have a special ability or position, but it is still cool to have a third character to switch to in this firefight. There’s only one more mission with all three characters left and this mission was already fantastic, and it only gets better.#5: MeltdownAt this point in the story, life seems to be going alright for Michael – he helped make his first movie, he is planning his biggest score, and he has his family back in his life. Unfortunately, Devin Weston is still upset because Michael didn’t listen to him and not only scared Molly into accidentally killing herself, but also prevented him from potentially making billions from a business deal. Because of this, he sends people to kill Michael’s family, meaning Jimmy and him must race back home, save his girls (wife and daughter), and take down the gunmen. Once again, this mission is mainly just a simple shootout, but the idea of Michael being in a tuxedo with his own pistol reminds me of 007 and him doing this not as a heist to gain money, but to save his family adds a sense of urgency that I appreciated; this game’s story is mainly played for laughs, but a dose of seriousness every now and then is nice, which is why I liked this mission a lot.#4: The Jewel Store JobThe first heist is one to remember and my personal second favorite of the bunch. While the Merryweather heist has a cool stealth element ending with a bang and the Bureau Raid is cool because you parachute into a highly defended federal building (if you did the roof option), this mission is great because, just like the shootouts, it is simple. You stake the place out, you analyze your options, you get the necessary supplies, and you rob a jewel store. There is very little in this game as satisfying as completing your first heist and seeing those bank accounts reach six digits, possibly seven for Michael. Plus, even though Trevor’s first mission didn’t make it to the list, it is the first mission after this and that was a great introduction for him.#3: Bury the Hatchet:Let’s ignore the graveyard shootout that is the focus of the latter half of this mission, as I’ve already established that I love the combat in this game. No, what makes this mission for me is the character dynamic between Trevor and Michael. Michael, sitting at home being his depressed self, sees Trevor walk in. Although they aren’t on the best terms at this point in the story, they seem to be bonding. However, this eventually turns sour and Trevor leaves in disgust, after finally starting to realize what happened in North Yankton and to Brad. Throughout the entire game, Trevor and Michael have this difficult relationship and this is, in my opinion, the climax of it – it all goes down here. What is also a nice bonus is when you are driving to the graveyard as Michael, you hear a voiceover of Michael’s past self explaining to Amanda why he must betray his friends. Just like Meltdown, this mission offers a small dose of seriousness to the otherwise silly story and just like that mission, I love it.#2: Monkey BusinessThis mission is the definition of cool in my book. Michael, along with Agent Haines and Davey, must infiltrate the IAA to retrieve a nerve toxin and then try to escape without being killed. Easy, right? Multiple components come together to make this mission one of the best in the game: firstly, diving underwater with your scuba suit, slicing your way inside the base, and sneaking around with your mask once again evokes the 007 aura of Michael; secondly, you have a stun gun to zap people and later in the mission, you go full-out with your pistol (or at least, that’s what I was using); thirdly, the first-person mode on the enhanced version makes this mission infinitely cooler. I’m not a huge fan of Call of Duty, but this mission reminded me of some of the better missions in the Modern Warfare trilogy, but with the GTA style – personally, I recommend using first-person mode while having the settings changed to automatically switch to third-person when you are in cover (this lets you experience the first-person perspective while still being able to easily take down enemies in cover). And to top it all off, the mission ends with Trevor returning Patricia to her husband, all while Chicago’s hit song, If You Leave Me Now, plays on the radio. The ending is both the saddest and funniest part of the entire game and that, along with the amazing infiltration aspect of the rest of the mission, is why it is my second favorite mission in the game.#1: The Paleto ScoreThe last mission was the definition of cool, but this mission is the definition of awesome. Sure, The Big Score was also a great mission and provided a large monetary reward, but there is almost nothing cooler in this game than Trevor wearing a juggernaut suit and mowing down (corrupt) police officers with a minigun. The mission isn’t very hard (or at least, it wasn’t for me since I selected Chef as my crew member), but it is the epitome of fun in this series. For the first part of this heist, I chose Trevor for his minigun and rage ability, then the game switches you over to Franklin to use a bulldozer (where his slow motion driving greatly helps), and for the ending part, I used Michael because we were heading inside and his slow motion shooting ability is very helpful for headshots. This mission utilized all the characters, even the crew member, very well, with all their abilities suiting their part in the mission. The intro, where you simply drive to the bank, is also hysterical because each member discusses their first score, effectively making all the members bond. This mission has it all: humor, guns, explosions, great character interactions, and above all else, it is fun. Those are the reasons that this is my favorite mission in the entire game.Thank you for reading and if you don’t have the game, go buy it now (unless you hate games and/or are easily offended)",5,2,Good
"After spending over 100 hours playing Grand Theft Auto 5 and completing everything story and multiplayer wise I feel that it is time to evaluate this commercially huge game. As one of the highest selling entertainment products ever, there are thousands of kids and adults playing this game right now. It goes without saying that Grand Theft Auto titles have become something of a household name due to both notoriety and the fact that they are great games boosted by critics and seasoned gamers alike. As an experienced gamer I have played most of the Grand Theft Auto titles that have been released and I know that my opinion counts in terms of what makes a good GTA game. I want to evaluate Grand Theft Auto 5 as a title and as a stand up to its predecessors, most importantly 2008’s Grand Theft Auto 4, which I and most critics and gamers worldwide agree to be a landmark in gaming (for its time). Also I would like to share some ideas I have for the future of the franchise and what could be possible in another GTA title.Grand Theft Auto games entail sex, drugs, guns, cars, planes, money, robbery, overly flamboyant characters, great humor, good music, I could go on. These are big, ambitious games and Grand Theft Auto 5 is no doubt the most ambitious GTA game yet in terms of almost all of these topics. That is not to say that it doesn’t have its faults, however. I want to start with the negatives of the game and end this assessment on the positives. Grand Theft Auto 5’s biggest flaws in my opinion lie in its graphics, size, story (somewhat) and lack of efficiency in terms of its online features. I want to start with the graphics by saying that they could have been so much better. I’m not one to pick apart a game for not having great graphics, but GTA 5’s graphics are weak compared to a lot of games released for the 360/ps3 generations (the ps4/ xbox one versions as well, although they are certainly better). I understand that it can be hard to maintain good graphics when there is so much to be done and seen in terms of the open world, but I still feel that the games visuals could have been polished a good bit more. Grand Theft Auto 4’s graphics were pretty groundbreaking in 2008 for an open world game, and I don’t feel that 5 has the graphics that it should as a follow up.  Also, I don’t feel that the game world is entirely big enough either. Los Santos and Blaine County together is by no means small, and there is plenty to fill the spaces and to be seen and done in these parts of San Andreas, but I can’t help but wonder why they didn’t do the whole state. San Fierro and Las Venturas? If the ps2 could hold the whole state of San Andreas then these consoles could have done so as well. I would have appreciated a bigger map. The story in Grand Theft Auto 5 is definitely a lot of fun and I don’t want to dog on it too much, but I will say that it trifles in comparison the fantastic story told in GTA 4, which is on a dramatic and creative level so much better. The story is so important to me as a gamer. The missions that I’m doing and the characters I meet and do them for have to be appealing. While the single player campaign in GTA 5 is fun, and hilarious throughout, it lacks the dramatic punch that 4 had.There could have been more to the development of the three playable characters. I’m not saying it had to be as serious and heavy handed as GTA 4 was, and the heists do make up for most of these problems, but there could have been more to the story. Last of my complaints (but certainly not least)  revolves around the online which has quite a few technical problems starting with its horrid loading times. Whether it be going from free mode to a death match or coming out of a game and back in to free mode the loading times are terrible. It takes away from all of the great features and game modes available via Grand Theft Auto online when the loading is so bad. Not to mention the bugs that I encountered regularly while getting to rank 100 online, from glitches to getting kicked out of games and missions before they were over to lobbies being poorly backed up. I know that Rockstar is constantly releasing updates for consoles to fix online issues and it has gotten better but there is still much to do in terms of polishing the online.Despite my complaints for the game, I did and do love Grand Theft Auto 5. I would not have spent the time on it that I did if I didn’t, and now I’m excited to focus on the positives. It was probably the funniest game I have ever played. Throughout the story missions and the strangers and freaks side quests (which are all excellent) I was laughing and most of the characters that you meet in the game are great. One of the side missions in particular surrounding a religious cult called the Epsilon program has probably become my favorite Grand Theft Auto mission of all time, possibly the most creative and hilarious thing Rockstar has ever come up with and that’s saying something. I admired the games ability to keep me entertained from mission to mission classic Grand Theft Auto style by staying so funny and entertaining. This humor a lot of people missed in GTA 4, which I can understand. The three playable characters themselves are interesting and different in their own ways. I liked all three of them, but I will say that psychotic Trevor brought the most life to the game for me. Michael and Franklin are much more sensible and most will find to be the better characters, but Trevor brought originality to the game with his dysfunctional personality that separates him to me as the most important character and the center of most of GTA 5’s best moments. The three character switching was something I was worried about when I found out about it during the development of the game, but it is really well done and interesting to switch back and forth between the three guys. I found myself laughing at what they had gotten into while I was away with another character. The game also does a good job of dispersing missions between them, I never felt forced on one character or that one was being neglected. Cars, guns, and planes make a big return in Grand Theft Auto 5 as well, as many people had missed from GTA 4, which had a lack of variety in these (no planes at all). Weapons and cars are fully customizable with some pretty cool perks. The heists, which are the centerpiece of the game and hold it together wonderfully with well-crafted vehicle (land, sea, and air) bits are all cool and original in their own way. I like the way that Rockstar uses them to draw the characters and stories together, and the setups and finales of the heists are the highlights of the single player game. The online heists that have been included as dlc are a lot of fun as well, especially if you have a good team to do them with. In terms of side quests and things to do in single player and online, Grand Theft Auto 5 is ripe with possibilities. All of the side missions from hunting, racing, rampages, parachuting and miscellaneous encounters are entertaining and appropriately challenging. I had fun reaching 100 percent completion of the game and even the collectible missions didn’t feel like a chore. Getting to rank 100 in multiplayer however I won’t say the same for because it was certainly a grind and with the online annoyances I mentioned earlier a lot was taken away from that experience. There is so much to do and appreciate with the online but Rockstar definitely needs to get to polishing it and making it reach its full potential. Even though I’m now technically done with Grand Theft Auto 5 single player and multiplayer wise, I still find myself playing it regularly. There is so much to be seen in the game that I still feel the need to revisit it. And I think that is what makes it a solid GTA. I think Grand Theft Auto 5 is a great game, and it succeeded in what it wanted to be.Do I think it is the swan song for the console generation and sent off the ps3 and xbox 360 as the best title, however? No, I do not. Do I think Grand Theft Auto 4 was a better representation of the power of these consoles for the time (in 2008) and in turn a better game? Maybe I do, maybe I don’t. It’s hard to compare the two. But, I think fans are pleased because it is a return to form for “Grand” Theft Auto, with so much to do and so much silliness that could never have been found in GTA 4. The fact is that it is amazing that Rockstar was able to create such great games that are so different and succeed with both of them. What direction the series takes next is going to be very interesting, and I can only hope that they find a somewhere in between with the success of these two titles now in the past. I wish for a game with the dramatic punch and technical prowess of GTA 4, with the size, fun, humor and possibilities of GTA 5. Perhaps this could be easier with only one character, and a totally new environment rather than visiting one from a past Grand Theft Auto game. I hope to see the next GTA game have a focused story and characters, with lots to see and do, good graphics, better designed online with less glitches and annoyances, and something new and original. That could be anything from vehicles to characters to missions, which are always great and entertaining in Grand Theft Auto games. But there are still so many possibilities and so much that hasn’t yet been done. I hope to see the next Grand Theft Auto fully realize this and seize its potential and hopefully not only meet the successes of these past two titles but surpass them.",4,5,Good

"What can I say other than this game is one of my favorites in my modest collection of games?I've only played GTA 4 and 5, but the first time I played 5, I admit I was a little hesitant. I had come off right from finishing 4, and my mind and heart were still with those characters in Liberty City, it almost felt fake to come here to Los Santos. I played these games on the PS3, so I played the prologue of GTA 5 and then took a break for awhile. After coming back after maybe a year, my perspective had totally changed. I'd missed the GTA world, and it was exciting for me to try new content. This time I had it for the PS4 and immediately my reaction was insanely more positive. Maybe it was just the graphics that bothered me the first time around, but this time that I played it was truly uplifting for me.The game centers around Franklin, Michael, and Trevor: a small time hustler, retired bank robber, and a deranged, trigger-happy guy respectively, who eventually find their way together and use their criminal cunning to fight for their freedom. It's an open world with a thoroughly engaging story line that had me enticed all the way to the very end. You get to switch between all three characters, doing missions and side quests to further you along the game. It took me awhile to finish my first play through, and when I wanted a break from the main story, there were plenty of Strangers and Freaks side missions to do where you help out (or con out) some pretty interesting people, along with random events that occur around town where you can cash in for a quick buck or play hero to some helpless civilian. My favorites are the collectibles, where you have to collect spaceship parts or letter scraps; finding all of them unlocks a unique Strangers and Freaks mission. Even after you finish the game, there's still plenty to do. I'm currently trying to get to 100% game play and that in itself is packed full of checks you have to get through on the checklist. It's enough to keep you occupied for months.The characters were pretty solid, the main characters anyway. Trevor is by far the most entertaining of the three with his general wackiness and psychopathic tendencies. Depending on your tastes, the events and dialogue centered around him are incredibly humorous and never fail to make me laugh. The graphics and driving are so much smoother than on the PS3, making the driving sometimes sensitive if you're used to the rough turns on its predecessor.GTA 5 is definitely worth the buy if you don't want to finish a game in a couple settings. The world is vast and full of goodies, like armor and ammo just lying around in the woods or underwater, so you can't go wrong there. With the PS4 version of the game, there are perks for returning PS3 players who played GTA 5 on there first, like exclusive weapons and missions. So, even if you already have the PS3 version, getting the PS4 version would not be a bad idea!",5,51,Good
"I resisted playing this for a couple of years. I was annoyed at the way the game started out with a somewhat challenging driving sequence. Additionally, the graphic language and initial characters seemed over the top stereotypical. HOWEVER, I finally gave this another try, recently, and I have to say, this game is fantastic. Yes, they use the ""F"" word over and over again (not a prude, just seems unnecessary), but you actually get used to it.The Good:The ""Los Santos"" or LA open world is amazing. Even though the game is a few years old, the graphics and much of the scenery is really beautiful. If you've ever live in LA, its amazing how familiar it all it. They've compacted the areas of the city, since making it true to size would be unrealistic, but don't get me wrong, it's huge.The driving get easier as you go along. Each car handles a little differently and after a short while of practice, the driving becomes quite easy. In fact, it's a BLAST to drive around the city and desert areas. I never obey traffic laws, and the cops don't seem to bother you for running red lights. It's easy to steal a car and use it when needed. Tons of different models, as well as motorcycles. Driving is a huge part of this game, but trust me, it gets really fun running from cops.This story in this game is amazing. At first, you're wondering why your playing these characters that seem a bit over the top, but as the story progresses, you see how they all come together and it becomes one of the most engaging and fun stories that you'll encounter in a video game. There's tons of side quests to do and hundreds of hours to put into it. You will likely find yourself becoming attached to the characters as you do in any good tv show or movie. Believe me, the characters and morality in this game are quite questionable, but once you realize it's just a game and enjoy it for what it is, then you will have fun.There's a whole money system, property, stock, etc...but make it what you want. Yes, it's good to buy some things, such as an airstrip for one of the characters, etc...but it's simple and you will earn money. However, you don't have to go crazy with it if you don't want to. There's a lot to learn in this game, but it's never a burden. Google is your friend.Bottom line: Give it a chance and make it through the first three or four hours to get to some of the better main missions, and you'll start to see why this game is so popular.",5,1,Good
"To start, I am a Rockstar games fan, especially the Grand Theft Auto franchise. I own GTA V for PS3 and I’ve played my moneys worth and more. In the past 6 months, GTA online has started to go downhill, less people, less DLC, the fading promise of heists online. Even I, as an avid GTA player, has gotten bored with it. When the Next gen announcements came, I wasn't to excited, I figured a few more shiny objects to please the masses. Then I looked deeper. I purchased the game for PS4, and i purchased a PS4 to play this game. There are so many improvements and changes, it is worth $60 more.The Aesthetics, Rockstar is known for detail. The previous gen was very detailed, but the new gen blows it out of the water! The way the grass moves and The rain falls. The graphics are not quite as great as the trailers,  but impressive to say the least. The way vehicles respond to impacts is more realistic. The draw distance Is amazing, You can pick A car's headlight in the distance, zoom in with your rifle and see it the car. There are more people, more traffic,  a variety of weather,  all making for a more immersive experience.New modes and Items, I couldn't possibly cover everything, so I will just cover my favorites. The first person mode Is awesome! Fully functional gauges in a cockpit view is something i've always liked in games, GTA V does it great. Flying is my absolute favorite activity in GTA, I am an aircraft mechanic and though the gauges aren't perfect, I really enjoy this new mode. If you've already beaten the single player,  I suggest playing it again in first person mode,  it's well worth the time.  Now I did own the previous gen, so I recieved a few extra things for upgrading,  the rail gun and the modified Duke. All insignificant extras,  but it was nice to have some extras thrown in for the players that upgrade.The online: I was concerned that upgrading and transferring from my ps3 to ps4 would have issues. The transfer was smooth and easy.  All vehicles,  weapons and items transferred just fine for me. The limit is still two properties,  there was a rumor a player could own 3. Unfortunately not.  The collectors edition items such as the carbon RS,  Hot Knife,  and Bullpup shotgun are now unlocked for everyone.  That's somthing I've been waiting a long time for. Unfortunately,  I was hoping for animals in gta online,  but that isn't a feature,  maybe in future updates.  Rockstar has also promised heists to be the first update,  but that promise comes with allot of warented skepticism.My verdict: If you couldn't already tell, I liked it. Its not just the common re-release, It improves and adds to the already great experience. Its well worth another $60 if you've owned it before, and if you haven't played it yet, You're missing out!",5,148,Good
"When this game originally game out I never played it. I knew what the GTA franchise was, and how well made their games were, but I never tried any of them for myself. Well come this November, many great games launched, and through the persuasion of one of my trusted friends, I bought this so we could play online together, I figured if I didn't like the game I would return it. When I first started up the game, I was met with a lengthy download patch, and after that it was off to the game. Since theres a lot of stuff to cover from a new comer's point of view I'll break my review into sections.Graphics - For Returning players this is a huge selling point, and the game definitely looks good. With its densely populated beaches, and heavily vegetated mountains, this game stands up. Its not the best looking game on the ps4, but its far from bad looking. The only gripe I have with the graphics are some muddy textures when getting up close to some things, and some hard to notice, but still there, pop in.Gameplay - This shouldent be to much of a surprise, but this is still the same game. Cars handle great, far better than watch dogs. Gun play is smooth, however, when in the first person view, there is a bit of delay when turning. This makes it hard to aim with out Auto Assist, this is a fairly big complaint, especially since many returning players are wanting to play this game like a fps. The mission structures differ with large variety, so much so its shocking compared to most other open world games. You never know what your going to do. You may end up pulling down some rich Mexican ladies balcony, to blowing up redneck's trailer homes, to even riding motor cycles on trains.Sound - From what I have played, the sound gets the job done. The sound of police sirens, and Grenade launchers causing huge explosions is definitely good, especially with a head set, however nothing really stood out to me.Story - I wont spoil anything, but the game's story fallows Micheal, Franklin, and Tevor. I found Micheal's personal story to be the best, but the characters are just so widly different, its easy to ensure that your favorite will differ from mine.All Around this is a good first try of the series, and it definitely makes me want more.",4,1,Good
"Nothing helps me unwind after a long day, like killing people on GTA 5. I'm a long time GTA player. Each game is somehow better than the last. Not just the story lines but the graphics.I initially had this for PS3 but recently upgraded to a PS4. Of course, that meant I had to repurchase my favorite games (which I wasn't thrilled about). Fortunately, it was well worth it. The graphics are insanely better! Plus, there are far fewer glitches and i've yet to witness any hacks (like people randomly blowing up everyone in the same room).Online game play is the reason I repurchased this. After beating them games a long time ago, I haven't felt the need to replay it, but the inline stuff is a lot of fun. With the PS4 version, you have MUCH more content! For instance, they have online challenges that are open to all players in the same room/lobby. A favorite of mine is ""Kill the Beast"". You're either the beast (who looks like Teen Wolf), or someone who is hunting the beast. It's quite challenging, as the beast is much stronger than your average player. It takes more effort to kill him. Plus, he isn't visible on your map for long periods of time. You can only see his purple blip, when he visits a landmark (which is the goal for the beast - to visit all landmarks before being killed). If you manage to kill the beast, you're rewarded with a nice chunk of change. The last time I killed him, it was over $12,000 earned. Woot!I definitely recommend playing with a headset. It's so much more fun. I keep my mic on while I play, to (playfully) tease other players. If you hear someone yelling 'Falcone-ayeeeee"", that's me (and i've just killed you).Long story short, this is a must have for all gamers (who are at least 18 years of age). Seriously, DON'T buy this for your kids. The language and some of the scenes are quite vulgar. It's fine for adults but I can't tell you how many times I've had my headset on, and ended up talking to 9 year old kids. Not cool. This is not age appropriate (especially with some of the hateful things that other players say).",5,1,Good
"This is easily the most entertaining and fun game I have ever played up to this point. I'm going to focus my review on the single player portion of the game since that's where I've had most of my game experience.GTAV has it all, action, adventure, drama, comedy, suspense. The missions are well spaced, so starting a single mission doesn't force you to devote more time than you want to during a playing session, but leave a satisfaction of getting something accomplished and the story moving along. There is lots and lots of side missions, entirely optional, but highly recommended solely for the entertainment value.One of my favorite scenes in the game played out during a side mission, a pretty basic one where I had to beat up a guy, I guess I could have killed him too but I wasn't feeling murderous at the time, and run away from the cops after they get called. Pretty basic. Well the car chase that ensued got a little out of hand because I got lazy with my driving and pretty soon I had a huge line of cop cars behind me. I started to dodge the the cops that tried to ram me off the road and the ensuing cop cars flying over my car, over other cars, across everywhere and into trucks was glorious. The amount of destruction caused by police in that car chase was incredible.Being able to watch the replay of that scene was even better thanks to the Share button.This game is full of unexpected sequences like this one and they can happen at any point. There are very few missions where your goal has a very linear approach. The vast majority of the time you have many different ways to approach a situation. No wrong way really. If say you're attacking a compound you can go in guns blazing, snipe the whole place out, or blow it up with grenades, the choice is yours. You can even get the bad guys after you, jump in a car, and run them down if you want to.If you're any kind of gamer, buy this game.",5,2,Good
As good as it was when they just released it.  Top class game :video_game:  a must have for older gamers.,4,0,Good
"This game is a lot of fun to play. It has enough new concepts and events in the game to keep you coming back. The storyline is so-so, the graphics are pretty good for GTA and the map is actually pretty large. The game mainly follows 3 characters around. You have Franklin who is a low level gangster like character in the city. You have Michael who is an ex criminal currently in witness protection living in the ritzy part of the same city as Franklin. Then you have Trevor who was one of Michaels accomplices and who is hiding in a small town in the desert to the North of the city. As you play, the 3 storylines quickly get intertwined together. Several missions center around the 3 characters being coerced into working for the Federal Bureau (like the FBI) doing their dirty work. In the process, you get to rob several places such as jewelry stores, weapons locations, etc. There are enough side quests and activities to keep you busy for hundreds of hours of gameplay and there are countless places to explore around the map. You can control pretty much every vehicle you find from submarines, to tanks, to choppers to normal cars. You also get the option to buy businesses around the map to add additional revenue to your characters. However, it will be a long time before you make your money back from said businesses. My final thoughts center around the stock market in the game. This stock market is pretty complex but just like the real world, it is affected by events in game. You can invest in a companies stock and then you can go and shoot up the competition and your stocks will rise in value. The market reacts to bad things and you ARE the bad thing. Overall, this game is solid and well worth the $40 I paid for it.",4,5,Good
I ordered this like a few days ago and it came with premium version even tough it didn’t say it was premium but I didn’t really mind it I had so much fun playing the game!,5,0,Good
"GTA V steals everything. Heists (from Heat), music (from every action flick ever), FPS combat (from Max Paine), and many, many hours of my life. The story may not be perfectly original, but its about the moments. After a few major missions, I popped back into my car the radio was playing a seemingly tailor made musical cue like ""Something in the Air"" after a heist, or ""Danger Zone"" after an aviation mission, and I found myself thinking, did the designers plan that? Or was that the channel I left my ratio on? The answer, I think, is the latter, but the catalog is so well curated, they all work.Much has been made about the FPS view of the Next Gen version, and, yeah, it gives the game a profoundly different feel. Sure, it's nicer for combat, but the bulk of the game is driving or walking, and it's not ideal for those. You can set it up so that you drive in 3rd person and shoot in 1st, but I found myself always switching back to 3rd person even in walking. It's the added detail, though, that mark the biggest improvements in the game. More vehicles, more people, more wildlife, all acting out their own little AI fantasies. San Andreas comes alive, and you're there, in the movie.It's definitely the most filmic GTA, and while the three characters are a little flimsy, the ability to switch from one character to another mid heist does change the dynamics. Even though the characters may be cutouts, though, the writing is loads of fun. By the time that Michael's explaining to Trevor how he's the original hipster, I was sold.My favorite GTA since Vice City, and my favorite game of the year, even though it's last years game.",5,0,Good
"I won't delve into the details of the game. It's been discussed so extensively elsewhere, it would be a waste of time.Bottom line: If you've never played this game, you need to grab it if you own a ps4 or xbone.  It's a must play game if you are mature enough to handle it.If you owned the game on a previous gen platform and loved it, it is absolutely worth owning again. The improvements make this game a silky smooth experience. Finally the graphics and visual presentation are a match for the incredible sound design and voice acting in this game. It is a sight to behold. The improvements really make this feel like a living, breathing world to explore. It's hard to explain, you really have to play to understand.I don't particularly like first person mode. It's nice to be able to switch to it on the fly if I want, but it's a bit jarring at times. It makes driving a little nauseating and feel even more unrealistic than it already was. In certain combat scenarios it helps to switch to first person, but in most cases I guess I'm too old school and revert back to playing it the way that's familiar to me. Some will love it, others will avoid it. That said, it is certainly not the game changer that it was touted to be in my opinion. It's a nice option, but it is not essential and certainly isn't the number 1 reason to play through this game again. The reason to play through it again is that it is the definitive version of one of the best games I've ever played and the level of immersion is unmatched in the genre of open world sandbox style gaming.",5,2,Good
"This was my first time ever playing any of the GTA's... and what an impact it had on me! I was introduced to video games in the Atari era... at that time, we had to actually rely on our imaginations to experience a real ""adventure"" playing video games. After a long hiatus without playing video games, I fell in love with Doom on the PC... It was a whole new world to explore, but still very limited. Again, after a few years away from video games, I got a last gen console, and GTA 5. It completely blew my mind. The missions are fun, the driving around, shooting (except from moving vehicles - the only problem with it), flying... it's exhilarating. The fact that this huge world is completely open and free to roam around at will is just incredible, and a lot of fun. Sometimes I just want to climb a mountain and take in the sights... and other times, drive around causing lots of mayhem. The changing in weather, the day/night cycle make it a lot more interesting. Walking around, one can hear a multitude of sounds, from the wind, wildlife, people talking, vehicles... it's just amazing. Every time you log on to it, you can just roam around to relax, or engage in a serious mission... it's your choice. If you see something going on, like someone asking for help, by all means stop what you're doing and see what happens... it's always a lot of fun.Other people have told this already, but it's always good to remind: DO NOT  give this game to your 10-12 year old as a gift; it's intended for adults only, really. Lots of violence, sex and some torture scenes inside. It's very realistic.",5,7,Good

"Best Open world game i have ever played. Lots to do, some aspects very realistic, Rockstar finally fixed the police and made them an actual threat to players. From swimming to basejumping, From robbing people to racing there are endless possibilities to this game. Campaign is not linear as their are side quest to do and alot of side missions allow for hours of single player fun and exploration. Multiplayer is riddled with your average hacker but with constant updates rockstar blocks these hackers and helps clean up the online gaming experience making it one that i truly enjoy and have lots of fun playing. Rockstar SocialClub allows players to make specific races and set up missions and races for players to partake in with friends and even if you don't have friends to play with it allows invite random people online or players with a similar skill set to yours to make online play enjoyable and fair all around for players. With many different ways to earn money players are set to doing missions repeatedly but instead can rob stores in the actual free roam and do special events going up against other players or AIs to get money and have a fun time. I have at least 2000 hours invested into this game. The game came in a new casing, well packaged and ready to play the moment it got here. Overall a great experience and I await Grand Theft Auto VI",5,0,Good
"This is quite possibly the best game of the year behind the Last of Us remake.The graphics are significantly improved - at 1080p with the revamped textures and effects this game outclasses some new generation titles. In particular, the rain effects are dazzling and surpass what was attempted in Watch Dogs. When driving or walking in certain bushes or grass, the grass bends creating a realistic action effect. Little touches like that including improved fog and other effects make this game graphically great.The controls are unchanged but a few button mappings. The first person view mode is incomplete. It is interesting, but it isn't as robust as a first person shooter featuring duck and cover (for example, the camera will always pan back to forward center in first person and I've never played a first person shooter that did that). My only complaint is that the range of motion isn't exact enough for my likely (kind of feels like the range of motion from Super Mario 64).Additional music has been added. That is a plus.The frame rates are steady for the most part except in rare instances in heavy traffic - I don't understand why there is slow down because I have played in instances where there are literally 30 to 40 vehicles on screen but in situations where there are 20 cars the game lags a bit. It isn't distracting and infrequent enough for me not to bother.This is a must purchase game for any PS4 owner.",4,0,Good
"Dear Rockstar Games,I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for not being a greedy company like EA games. With EA games, you're basically buying a quarter of the game and to unlock the whole game, prepare to see them all in downloadable contents (DLC). EA games also releases a ""new"" game yearly with same old recyclable materials. If Grand Theft Auto V was created by EA games, it would probably be titled Grand Theft Auto 2019 and have about one every year by now. Every costume will be DLC. SO with that being said, thank you for providing us with such an amazing game for 60 bucks.As for the game, you can expect everything and more in a Grand Theft Auto game. Amazing story, amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, and so much more! The game also comes with Grand Theft Auto Online with support for 30 players and 2 spectators. Both the online version and the single player story mode are incredibly fun and you will get so much value out of your money! Highly, highly recommended!Value 5/5 *****. Gameplay 5/5 *****. Online Gameplay 5/5 *****. My Recommendation 5/5 *****.",5,23,Good

"I've been a fan of the GTA series since Day One on the original Playstation. GTA V was no different when it originally came out on PS3, as it was a day one purchase for me as well. This game has, in my opinion, the best story line of any games in the GTA series. There are a few upgrades in the PS4 version such as different weapons, environments, animals/'wildlife, vehicles, and most notably, first person mode. While I'm not a big fan of first person mode, there is a trophy for it if you play the game for so many hours in first mode, so there is a small incentive to using it.As far as previous game data transferring from PS3 to PS4, the ONLY data the will transfer is that of your online character. So, if you're hoping that your single player/story mode progress will cross over, well, don't set your hopes too high. You will need to start completely from scratch when it comes to story mode, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for holding replay value.So, long story short, this is a great game, yet again, with updated graphics for Next Gen goodness as well as other little perks here and there. I highly recommend it for those who enjoy the GTA series and even those who are new to it. However, parents, please do NOT let your kids play this as the language, violence, and general tone is NOT for kids by any means.",5,0,Good

"generally i never got too into the GTA games after San Andreas, mostly because they got too dark and too gritty and felt like a bunch of recovery missions. also i am a terrible videogame driver.this game stars off slow, until you get into michael's storyline and then it just really picks up and becomes really enjoyable (sorry franklin, you're just kinda boring). i live in LA and this is just a brilliant piece of satire as the city is clearly as much a character in the game as franklin, michael, and trevor...maybe moreso than franklin since he was kind of boring.the best piece of advice someone gave me about this game was to not stress out about driving well, and that made all the difference in the world. now i just crash cars and loot buildings and have a great time. the online multiplayer, at least on the PS4 is sort of meh in that it's really slow and sometimes parties just break up (which is a bummer when you're playing a heist) but the story is great and funny and gross and horrible, the characters are for the most part really well fleshed out and multidimensional, the graphics are top notch...it's a fun game, which i think is important to stress since some games out there, that i still love, feel more like tests of endurance (yes bloodborne, i'm looking at you)",5,1,Good

"If your hear you already know...... This game is so much better than the PS3 version its attrocious. Felt like i was playing a whole new game .Pro Tips on switching your account :  Make sure you have a PlayStation Network Account and PlayStation Plus membership.  If you’re transferring to the PS4 from the Xbox 360, make sure your Rockstar Social Club account is linked to your Xbox Live account and your PlayStation Network account. You can check here.  Start GTA 5 on PS4 and log in to PSN.  Select GTA Online from the pause menu.  You are now given the option to transfer your GTA Online character and progression. You are also given the option to change the appearance of your character with the new creation options.  When you agree to transfer your character all your RP, money and rank of your character will be displayed.  If you have character data on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 this is the point you must choose one. You can only transfer one save from either your Xbox 360 or PS3 over, so choose wisely.  Once it’s transferred over you’ll be prompted to choose a character and away you go. Welcome back to GTA Online!",5,1,Good

"Probably one of the greatest games ever made. Outstanding graphics and exploration options by foot, car, boat, helicopter and jets. The plot is very well written and very interesting. This socio-political satire of the American way of live is quite accurate and does a great job of blending humor and realism in a very tasteful way. This game has a little bit of everything whether it's driving from the very urban setting of the city to cruising along a beach or stock car racing across the vast and open desert. This game lets you take the reins and lets you make the decision, whether they be to shootout a liquor store with the police responding or participate in a triathlon. The options and decision for this game are endless as we explore the rooted lives of our three interesting protagonists as they adventure onto a collision course with gangs, government forces, private security and their own unique ties to one another.The online portion of the video game offers a similar experience with your own created protagonist as you explore the map and do missions and just have fun with your friends or new people you meet along the way. GTA Online is an ever expanding world that changes and offers new experiences to the players: the funnest online I have ever encountered.",5,0,Good
"I must have spent over 1000 hours on this game. Online mode is highly addictive and very fun.The story is very good and has multiple endings. Your choices will impact the game's finale and the heists are a lot of fun. They are all different, varied and add a lot to the game mechanics. The story was gritty and the three characters are really diverse and have interesting backgrounds that many could relate to. The whole city is blossoming with interesting places, people and many easter eggs. It is almost impossible to see and do everything that has been put into this game.The online heists are even better, as long as your team mates can follow instructions as most can't. The game focuses a lot on microtransactions for online items as they are so expensive that casual players cannot boy them. If you have a good team for heists and activities then you can earn a lot and quickly. But finding  a team through matchmaking that will communicate effectively is very rare.",5,0,Good
"I upgraded from PS3 and the game itself is different. You can do fps or third person on the ps4 version. There are more avenues of game play and the graphics are better.That being said, I had to purchase the game which was a downer as I had hundreds of dollars and hours into my PS3 game. I was able to transfer one character but the rest I lost. I had to pay for a new game because the downloadable PS3 version can not upgrade (seems silly) even tho I had 4 downloads available. There is no discount price AND you have to pay to play online on a ps4. I'm the end, this was why I upgraded to a ps4 and to be honest, it was not worth it on its own. Rockstar seems more worried about sales than retention of long term players. That is unfortunate. The game itself, amazing without doubt. The creator, seems a little money grubby. I played right into their hands tho, and I paid the money :shrugs: l hope I can get into playing it so it can pay off.",5,4,Good
"I have played several of the GTA installments and have spent hours upon hours playing them, but I eventually grew tired of them and lost interest.This one is different, and for a couple of reasons. The 1st reason is because it appears that Sony finally has utilized the PS4 capability developing on this platform.The realism is remarkable. My wife saw my character by the beach and literally recognized where I was as she had been there when she lived in LA. The cracks in the highways, buildings, I can go on. The character interaction and activities is like a real world simulator.Next is that they have multiple characters that you play as separately that all have special abilities, personal lives that are all intertwined at different points of the game.Next are the missions. The missions never get boring and repetitive because the developers took their time and made sure that no details were left out. Example, like the handling of the dual sport motorcycle that was in the “Italian Job” like jewel heist, the cop chases, shootouts, reconnaissance missions, triathlons, strip clubs,  I can go on and on.This is definitely a consideration for game of the year.",5,2,Good

"I bought this copy for a friend, but personally I'm a level 220+ online.  It's great.  Multiplayer: Free roam and hunt online newbs, earn money doing missions / heists / VIP work or just stealing cars, race awesome cars that are fully customized, play in deathmatches, and LOTS more!  It's pretty crazy how much time was put into developing this game, and working out the kinks.  Right down to the radio stations that play well-known music.This is NOT a game for little kids.  If you're adult and can tell the difference between real-world violence and virtual, then try this game.  You'll be pleased!Personally, I spend about half of my time in the game flying.  There are many different planes, jets, and helicopters to cruise around in.  I happen to own all of them, and as soon as you crash one -- you can call in another.Seriously, I can't say enough.  I am addicted to this game and have been for years now, I just hope they never come out with GTA 6! ha ha!",5,4,Good

It’s a perfect game for the whole family:face_with_tears_of_joy:In all actuality GTA5 is a really fun game if you are the type of person to play these games. It is literally called grand theft auto. Please don’t buy this game for kids, but as an adult there are a lot of fun things to do in game besides actual missions. Personally I like italics the feature where I can take any car in game which relates similar to most actual car models and upgrade them in various ways to see how that car would look. This helped me figure out what colors to paint my car",5,0,Good
"The only GTA game I've played all the way through was GTA III for the PS2 when that first came out. I've always made it a third of the way through on other GTA games, but there was never enough there for me to feel like I needed to finish them.That being said, this game will soon be the second GTA game that I've ever played to the end. The story is told at a great pace, giving you time to get a better sense of each character that gets introduced. The mission objectives and mechanics varied greatly enough to keep me wanting to go mission after mission.The gameplay is awe inspiring. It appears that they've put a lot of care into each game mechanic, unlike previous iterations. It feels great because now it truly feels like an open world with no limits. The transitions between gameplay, cutscenes, and entering building interiors are now seamless leaving no break in the action.Tons of fun. Definitely recommend this if you have ever enjoyed a GTA or GTA-like game. Even if you haven't, the technical achievement of the game itself is something to behold.",5,11,Good
"Awesome game. Best game graphics ever. Extremely long and fun campaign, one of the best &amp; longest game campaigns ever. Wild and crazy gameplay. Also has good humor. GTA 5 sets a new bar in video games and puts most other games to shame. GTA 5 contains massive content &amp; value, whereas most games don't. Rockstar North creates games for the love of creating great games, unlike companies such as Electronic Arts, Bungie, and Activision, which make games mostly to cheat &amp; exploit consumers for profits. I just finished the GTA 5 campaign and I am extremely impressed, as much as I was extremely disappointed and angered by Bungie's horrible game, Destiny. GTA 5 proves that gamers still love great single player campaigns. The real reason many people skip the campaigns in the Call of Duty games is because they suck! I love the zombies mode in Black Ops II and Advanced Warfare, but the campaigns failed to grab my interest and I didn't finish them. GTA 5 reminds me somewhat of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, because there are many interesting characters, humor, and side quests.",5,1,Good
Grand theft auto five is definitely a great game. I already had the game for the Playstation 3 platform so I had to get it for for the Playstation 4 platform as well. Rockstar Games did an absolutely amazing job making this game. The graphics are very impressive in this big open world game. So much detail that it's almost life like. The story mode is great because you are playing as three different characters that you can switch between. I have to say that Trevor is my favorite character because when switching to his character you never know where he is going to be on the map. The missions are fun and can actually be quite challenging. The online play is also a big plus for me because all of my friends have the game as well. This game is definitely the best of the Grand Theft Auto series. This game gets a 5 star rating and  two thumbs up from this gamer. Thank you Rockstar Games for doing it right.,5,0,Good
"I see a lot of 5 star reviews and a lot of trolls with 1 star reviews so I thought I'd weigh in, I've been playing my copy for a while now and I had the Xbox 360 version as well.  The key difference is appearance and boy does this game look great, everything is sharp and bright and it's really a pleasure on the eyes, after a while the 360 version would hurt my eyes due to a low resolution and framerate drops.  Secondly this game has a 1st person mode, it seems kind of neat but to be honest I prefer using 3rd person and the feature feels kind of tacked on, I'm not saying it's bad but it's not as good as everyone is making it out to be, overall this is a re release and it's great but my biggest issue is with the framerate, at 30fps it doesn't feel as smooth as it should but nonetheless it's a great game and worth the $60, I'd give it a 4/5 on the ps4",4,2,Good
"There is nothing more entertaining than leading a reckless, criminal, and frivolous lifestyle in one of the most disturbed cities in ""America"". Obliterate police cars by the dozens, sky-dive out of a fighter jet, abuse a stripper, and simply wreak havoc in Rockstar's fantastic and realistic interpretation of Southern California. Swear words litter the script, graphic images surprise viewers, and the pure freedom of the game is shocking. Parents who are buying this game for their children should definitely do this. Despite being able to slaughter masses of pedestrians and visit ""Gentlemen's clubs"" the real life aspect of the game aids in decision making, important values, and freedom of action, something many kid's don't have access to. All the malevolent activities you can participate in while playing, are quite irrelevant to the realistic things you can do. Scuba diving, flying planes, and trekking through the wilderness are just a few things that make the game absolutely brilliant. Bottom line: GTA V is an amazing video game allowing one to do whatever they want, weather that is robbing a jewelry store or flying through the beautiful city sky.",5,2,Good
"This game is not without it's flaws. But given it's scope and ambition - after some pretty major initial glitches - is second to very few other games.Single player world is more alive, more detailed, and interesting (collectibles, characters, vehicle variety), compared to the online mode.The worst to me about GTA is the awful online community. Unless you have friends or meet people elsewhere, like on reddit or such, you're bound to be annoyed by the online free roam.There are a gazillion online jobs, and still to this day, many people host the same few jobs because they pay out the most. Because of the need to earn in game money to afford cool gear, the online community is obsessed with playing high paying jobs. This is totally against the spirit of the game design, unfortunately.I wish the developers of this ""most commercially successful entertainment product in history"" (Businessweek)  would have paid more attention to the interplay between gamers, and worried about how to interact with one another, instead of the enormous size of the map. Games like Battlefield allow gamers to communicate effectively for a lot of basic things, like ""get in the car"" or ""follow me"", because one thing in online gaming is guaranteed: if everyone has a mic, you hear more background noise than actual people speaking. Judging from the consistent lack of mic users even on new gen consoles, I'd venture to guess that the majority of online gamers dislike hearing a random person yell expletives at them all day. Which is, unfortunately, all to common in this community.",3,8,Normal
"Well worth purchasing again. This is the way Grand Theft Auto was made to be experienced. Incredible visuals and exciting new features bolster this epic title.Personally, I love the fact that I can transfer my character from platform to platform. That shows that Rockstar respects the gamer and all of the progress one has made. Let's be honest. GTA V, from the beginning, has been a journey. We have waited long enough for heists. We dealt with the balancing of the online economy which ultimately resulted in many users wrongfully losing in-game currency. We moved on to next-gen consoles, but continued to come back to the older systems just to play GTA, which pushed the current-gen consoles to their max.If this is your first GTA, buy it. I feel sorry for you missing out on Vice City, San Andreas, and Liberty City, but better late than never. If you've taken a break from GTA, come back to this series. If you bought GTA V for PS3 or Xbox 360, buy this again. You won't be disappointed.",5,1,Good

I waited a bit and bought it.  I liked how my online money and items transferred from when I played the other version.  The single player game did not transfer over, so you will have to start from scratch for the single player.  The game is beautiful and fun.  If you enjoyed the GTA games, you will enjoy this one.  The graphics for the PS4 are better then what I remember from the 360 (which they should be).  Rockstar didn't just port a PS3 or Xbox 360 game over to the next gen. They worked hard at making it a better experience without creating a new game.",4,2,Good
"This is a good game. I should say that the last GTA I played was San Andreas and I was frankly somewhat disappointed to play this game as I had very high expectations after hearing nonstop from my friends. Yes the game has significantly better graphics and the gameplay consists of playing 3 different characters in the same game which was new to me.My biggest disappointment was that the game ended very quickly. San Andreas had a lot of missions that involved a wide array of activities that were crucial to complete that game however this didn't have much of that. I finished the game in less than 20 hours so was a little disappointed.All in all, it's a good game but I know that Rockstar Games can do a lot better with the storyline",4,1,Good

"I have this game on the PS3 and up till yesterday played the game almost every day on that system. This new version though is a masterpiece! I have not yet tried transferring my online character. But playing as Franklin in story mode last night for a couple of hours was awesome! I found myself starting random fights in the street in first person mode just to do it, It looks that good! I have had a PS4 since the beginning of July but have not used it much because I just could not stop playing GTA online on the PS3. Anyway, I was a little skeptical at first to re buy a game I already own and love, I mean up until GTAV came out on ps3 my favorite game of all time was Vice City on ps2. But i am glad I did. If you are on the fence about purchasing go ahead and take the plunge and rebuy, you will not be disapointed.",5,0,Good

"Rockstar has imported the same fantastic game on ""current gen"" to ""next gen"" and now has never been a better time to get this game. Running at 1080p at 30 fps is certainly an upgrade, and graphics are pretty damn good. The world is densely populated and detailed. GTA online is never spotty and holds up to a max of 30 players. Story is diversed with different missions, but usually having to drive to everywhere gets tiresome after some time. With the ps4 version, the dualshock 4 is immensly utilized with the touchpad and speaker, which is great with being a cross platform game. Every review has her own perspective on the new first person, and heres mine: First person is a touch that makes the game harder as there is a smaller range of view. It's different and a bold step by rockstar. I like it.GTA 5 is the same great game created a year ago, but is ""greater"".",5,0,Good
"Like many people, I first played this game when it was released on the previous generation of consoles. Back then it was one of Rockstars best games and the same can be said today (C'mon Rockstar, give us Red Dead Redemption remake!). I was a little apprehensive in re-purchasing the game since I put a lot of hours into the original but I have no regrets. The improved graphics and better frame rate make the world feel even more alive. Simple things like switching between characters is much faster. Also, the added first person POV can easily be toggled by clicking the touchpad on the PS4 remote. I wouldn't recommend playing that entire game in that mode, but it definitely has its appeal. Overall, if you haven't played this title, this is the version to get. And if you have, well, enough time has passed to return to Los Santos.",5,0,Good
"There is so much to like about this game I won't even talk about. I don't have a problem with the violence and lewd nature of the environment and situations but why do so many of the characters have to be dirtbags. I'm a nice guy and would like to play a character that is a nice guy and has a nice guy story to start. Let the player become a dirtbag if they want, not start off that way. Running over people and mowing them down with a machine gun would feel much more significant and impactful if you could identify with the character rather than starting the game automatically branded a dirtbag of whom most people are not or at least not yet in my opinion.",4,0,Good
"This was a well anticipated game! The story line was a great cross from what Rockstar has done in the past, so I loved being able to switch between 3 concurrent (yet still different) stories and characters. Online is a great improvement, also. In fact, I find myself Online more than in story mode. The ability to claim and set bounties, fulfill independent or team missions, or ranking up makes the online experience something that we've never seen before on GTA. Online was not without some bugs and late deliverables, but here's to hoping 2015 is a year of excitement! This is definitely a game worth buying. The revisit to Los Santos (previously from GTA San Andreas of Xbox) was worth the wait. The graphics of this gen's format and first person playing really add to the overall GTA experience.",4,0,Good
"Really loved this game! I didn't think GTA 4 was all that great, but GTA V makes up for it. I liked that you have three characters to play at once, and you can switch between them to try different missions. And for some missions, you play all three characters at once, and can switch between them to provide cover fire for each character or to do something specific.Overall, the game is a series of heists that you plan out, set up, then execute. The ""heist"" gameplay made it fun, always felt like you were progressing the story (unlike GTA 4, which felt like you were just churning through large parts of the story until something else came along).The big value of the game is the online games. I'm not a big online gamer, so I didn't play too much of that.",5,0,Good
"The PC version is plagued with KINDA, SORTA, ALMOST real 1st person controls. Rockstar did technically implement them, but they feel very generic like the controls, or ""feel"" from a $5 budget title game. The game itself had a fun story, not short, good characters all around. There is a torture scene that the game does not allow you to bypass. There is only meaningless, empty online ""addons"" from Rockstar now. No singe player stuff, so if you buy it now for console or PC you might as well play it as is. The online content are just textures for clothes, cars, and some new models for vehicles (materialistic).4/5 because even as good as it is, no love for SP addons, and the modding is limited on the console versions!",4,2,Good
"Played the PS3 version to death, even played the story mode a few times on it, it's obvious the PS4 version is better graphically and makes for a better gaming experience. But I wouldn't necessarily say it's a must-have if you already have it for the PS3 but only money to spend on just 1 game. 1st person, while a good idea, is just ok in actual practice. I actually still prefer 3rd person most of the time. Driving a car in 1st person is pretty tough and requires more restraint than in 3rd person. Shooting in 1st person becomes way too easy, if it already wasn't before in 3rd person, but watching hand to hand combat is pretty cool. Overall, this is a fantastic looking game on the PS4 that you must get if you don't have it for previous gens, but may want to think about if you already have it.",5,1,Good

Tonnes of content, great story, memorable characters and I am only talking about single player.If you decide to jump in online that's a whole another beast that can be hit and miss. Online introduces grind, microtransactions and sometimes less than nice people. The great thing is that if you don't want any of that you can keep playing solo. This game is definitely worth it just for the singleplayer experience alone.",5,0,Good

I had such difficulty getting the hang of playing again but it is coming back to me.  I love the storyline and always having something in the game to do.  My stepdad even liked it, which I was surprised because these used to not be his kind of games.  Honesty, this is the only game I play on the PS4.  I don't get to play often but when I do I take full advantage of it and have a good time!",5,13,Good
"I really liked this game when it came out for ps3/xbox360, and the same is true for the update for the now current Gen consoles (I have it for the ps4).I really like the new first person view, as it adds more immersion to the game. It can make you a bit dizzy though when you fall down or get git by a car :P.The increased density of traffic is also pretty cool. It feels more like a live city than the last gen did.They also increased the online cap pet server to 30 (from I think 12-15 last Gen? Don't quote me on that) which adds a lot more for races and random riots.Overall I really enjoy it, but these are just my thoughts and with a game such as GTA, it can be seen very differently for different types of people.",5,5,Good
"It's definitely a good game for a new players. The game has good visual, especially for people who are interested in cars and there are day and night times. which makes it feel more realistic. You also get to play different characters with different personalities. The story is mostly about doing dirty work with people from the hood and getting away from the cops.I think the game did a lot better than GTA4, but there just isn't much to it, where every mission I'm either killing people or stealing from a jewelry store. It's better to switch between others games and come back after a few days, so the game doesn't few old.",4,1,Good
"So GTA 5 is about the most fun game there is, if you're willing to wait a while, or pay up front, for what makes the game fun.Your best strategy for this game is to join a crew that has a peaceful lobby that will allow you to complete your missions worry free of grievers. Otherwise be prepared for non stop harassment by those who own all the cool toys. And don't you even think about blowing them up since it'll cost you dearly.It'll take you a while before this game pays off, fair warning. It's designed that way intentionally. Unless you're willing to invest right out of the gate, this game will be painful to get going.But if you don't mind investing say 39.99, they got a decent starter pack that should make the game more than tolerable.This game falls short of almost eveything it was supposed to be. The things it mocks in this very game, it became just that. A company obsessed with milking its customers, and spamming them with things they don't need.Graphics: 10/10Options: 10/10Storyline: 7/10Microtransaction obsessed: 10/10 (watch reviews on youtube before buying anything)Memorable game: 10/10",3,1,Normal

sweet game looks beautiful &amp; runs smooth on ps4 only problem I've been having is that when I quit playing &amp; return to play again its starts a new game so I half to go in &amp; load my save &amp; no problems it continues were i saved also at times it does work right &amp; continues my save &amp; don't start a new game but for only a brief time &amp; goes right to a new game so same issue just that first time it did that I thought cool its fixed somehow but nope I have auto save enabled as well so hope there's a patch that fixes this issue but unless its a issue for all ps4 gta 5 owners I may b out of luck &amp; its something Iam experiencing for some reason just other than that issue all is smooth going,5,0,Good
"I am a 49 year old gamer.  I have had the Grand Theft Auto series since my GameBoy days.  The style, play, and graphics of this edition is out of this world.  You really have to see it to believe it.  I run through the town taking out everything and everyone I can.  Sheer fun.  If I had to nick this it might be that there is no senior mode.  As an old gamer, I would like to go through all the assignments but just cannot for the life of me do the hand/eye coordination thing fast enough.  I wish it had a way of allowing me to complete the tasks with a little extra help and explore the world within the game.  That said...it's GTA and you are compelled to own it.",5,4,Good
My husband loves the game a bit graphic for young people.,4,0,Good
Honestly this is a game if you not cannot play it as such then you do not need to have it I believe this to be an adult gay if you're an adult and you let your child play this and they act out situations they find in game or if they get an attitude because you can't let them play the game or or violent do not let them have this game. Rockstar does a good job of updates but there are still plenty of exploit they refuse to fix and allow the cheaters to run amok with aimbotting glitching modifications and all-round general environment that makes a good time negative for a honest player,5,0,Good
I love it,5,0,Good
"For years Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas has been my favirote from the franchise. And with very high expectations with GTA 4 with the ps3 i was very disappointed. Grand Theft Auto V for the ps4 has surpass the expectations i had and has brought me back to the GTA world. In my opinion GTA V is the best off all in the franchise and its very well crafted with alot more to offer. This game is ultimately fun and will drive you right into the action world, with that said and the fact that GTA 4's online play sucked, GTA V's online gameplay is a whole new world and refreshingly awesome!",4,2,Good

"I haven't been a big fan of the GTA games in the past and hadn't planned on getting this one until it was recommended by a friend for the good story and wide variety of things to do.  I have to say it was a great purchase!  If you can deal with the R-rated language and situations, you'll find it's a very fun and engaging open-world game.  The amount of things you can do is mind-blowing.  There are so many little side-quests and encounters, I don't know how anyone could ever do them all!  The world is detailed and feels like a real city.  I'm looking forward to many more hours of entertainment for this game!",5,2,Good
"So great. I owned it for Xbox 360, and felt silly buying it again for a next gen system, but am really I glad I did. Graphics are stunning, GTA Online is vast and awesome. New online content is being added often, always plenty of people online to do online specific missions with. I'm starting to get the hang of how to make GTA $ and am enjoying establishing my online avatar in the world. The new stunt races are super fun. Just get used to other players being jerks in general and trying to wreck you in races.  Its just unavoidably part of it. It is satisfying though when they try and wreck themselves instead. :)",5,0,Good
"I am not a ""gamer"".  I am just a dad who needed something other then Skylanders or Lego games to play.The game is just challenging enough.  You can play for hours and not progress in the game.  There is a 100 hours of things to do that doesn't have to do with missions.  i.e.  fly a helicopter over the island, go for a dirt bike ride, climb a construction crane take a few shots then do the honorable thing.The only thing I don't like is there is a ton of foul language though the whole game.  I knew it before I bough the game so I wasn't surprised, but it is hard when you have kids.  It really limits the times I can play it.",5,0,Good

"Its what GTA5 would have been if last gen didnt hold it back, but expect no online wildlife, they took away online wildlife through an update on last gen because it couldnt handle it but you'd think it would on next gen but they haven't even tried it, they might do it through a future update but i doubt it :/As a rockstar fan since 2004 i had to get this game but because i've played gta5 on last gen for a long time and then playing the next gen version it'll be an amazing experience at first but then goes away pretty fast, i love the constant 30fps and first person but i now rarely play it these days, this game is best when you have a lot of friends to play with",5,0,Good
"The game arrived before the estimated delivery time.   However, when opening the game box, I noticed that it is broken the ""eyelashes"" that hold the map and instructive. Probably at the time of packaging, he suffered some small blow, so that section was broken.   However, the album is not scratched and is in perfect condition. Additionally, a code comes to download content on GTA online.   I do not omit With some recent launch.",4,1,Good
"Played the PS3 game quite a bit. Love this game even though the single player campaign should have had more heists. Playing online is also a lot of fun. There's so much to do from playing through missions to just driving around with friends and doing stupid stunt jumps. There is SO much detail in this game I'm still finding funny things after a year.The graphics upgrades look much better when compared to PS3 side by side. But honestly I did not notice anything more special when playing the PS4 version. One of the best features that they added was the first-person camera. It's difficult to play with it, if you're trying to be competitive, but it really makes you appreciate the detail that went into this game.",5,0,Good
I lovw this game but for whatever reason the full text isnt dispayed on the screen. It makes it difficult to follow the speech and action prompts. The story mode is interesting but sometimes it gets in the way of the classic rampage gameplay. However its also a nice change to have a story and people missions rather than just car crashes and criminal activity,4,1,Good
"I reviewed this for PS3 and I gave it five stars. I would give this version more if I could. Everything great from the old game is still there, but now it looks better, runs more smoothly (although still at 30fps), and even has some added stuff. At first i was skeptical at the idea of buying the same game again, but now I think everyone should do it. It looks a lot better, and has an amazing first person mode. I played the whole campaign through just in first person. It also has new cars, over 100 new songs, and some extras for returning players. Even if you buy this again, you won't regret it!",5,4,Good
"Hands down, the best game on the PS4. Despite having beaten this game on the PS3, I was glad to hear it was making its way to the PS4. The game definitely looks better than it did on the PS3, and it's nice to have bigger lobbies online.However, the PS4 version suffers from the same network issues the last-gen editions did. I spend more time loading than I do playing with my friends. When I actually manage to connect to the same lobby as any of my friends, it's not immediately easy to navigate to where they are. Furthermore, joining jobs together seems impossible. I find myself having to host jobs and invite my friends. A way to join jobs as a group would be much appreciated.",5,0,Good
To the kid who said that you have to buy gta online separately. That's a lie! Anyone with a ps4 and some common sense would know that any online actions on ps4 u need playstation plus DUMMY! Anyways the game is a massive upgrade from the ps3 and xbox 360 and transferring characters wouldn't be easier all you need is your rockstar social club email and password and you can play your old online account on the new enhanced gta v for next gen consoles. You can only do this one time so if you have both consoles and gta v u might wanna choose wisely on which console is going to have the online account. First person view is stunning and I totally recommend for retuning players or new future players.,5,3,Good
old game but always fun &amp; a pleasure to play it.One of the best game that i have ever played.Seems like you are in a real life and you can do all those stuff that in the real life you can not do it because of the law.,5,0,Good
"GTAV is an amazing game, especially on PS4. I have to take a star off for two reasons: 1) input lag. I had to mess with the controller settings for 30 minutes to even get the game to a playable level, and it's still not perfect. Controls are just too muddy and laggy. 2) the mission system drives me crazy. It's hard to tell exactly what you're supposed to do next after you complete a mission. The map is confusing and unclear. Maybe I'm missing something but I think it could have been better. Nevertheless, the game is great.",4,0,Good
It is definitely a good game and addicting to play because you get to kill people drive on people kill other players and do heists and go to the barber and go to the clothes store and go to the strip club and go to the beach and tell other players some shot.,5,0,Good
"I debated with myself if I were to take off 1 star due to weird UX issues of setting up online play... But then the gameplay, graphics, and just pure fun overrode my decisions. There are so many things you can do in this game! Want to jack a tractor? Yes, it can be done. Want to race through the skies in a parachute race? They got that too! Just tired and want to goof off with a few sets of tennis? The game has that too. The latest release of 'Heists' are some pretty great co-op missions that can keep you busy too. And don't forget about the music or satire, because it really does set the mood and puts together an awesome game environment.",5,2,Good
This is a great deal and about the best deal you will find I recommend buying this great deals,5,0,Good

"10/10 stars. Even though it is a remake from the PS3/Xbox 360 version, they went above and beyond the call of duty for having a one year later release time. The graphics boost looks incredible after upgrading to the next-gen system. Graphics alone would be a great reason to buy the game. The biggest thing however, which everyone is raving about is the first-person mode. This personally sent me over the edge to the point where I'm going to stop typing this review and say that to any fan of GTA, this mode is a must try. It will alter your view on GTA in hopefully the best way possible. Rockstar did a very very stellar job with integrating the first person into this game. Graphics, fun, guns, woo.",5,0,Good
This game is insane! the virtual world is huge in size and the detail put into this game is off the chart! I’ve been playing it for many months now and I just reached the point where I can start buying property so I’m not sure how far along in the game that puts me. Buy this game! you won’t be sorry.,5,1,Good
"Although online gaming isn't exactly what I wanted it to be... the game is still great. I find myself coming back to this game all the time when I am bored with the other games I am playing. As always the game received critical reviews in regards to the vulgarity and violence, but if you don't like it, don't play it, don't want your kids playing it, be more involved in their lives. Don't ruin it for the rest of us, let us enjoy our mindless animated violence. If you have played any of the other GTA games you will love this one, sticks to the good old stuff while introducing very unique characters with a high replay value for online as well as single player.",5,2,Good

"There is no problem with the game itself.  However, Amazon's delivery is too late.  Other courier companies are responding quickly.  It takes 3 hours from that, even though I am coming to a nearby delivery station.   I know I'm busy, but I'm a member and I want you to deliver it a little earlier.  The game itself is a star 5.  I have purchased it twice (laughs)  Even if it is PS5, it is said that it will be out, but I wanted you to put out 6 ...  PS4 online will continue for a while, so you may be able to play a little more.  I think PS5 will evolve as well.  For a while, I can play with PS4! !   I think that beginners can buy it now.   Overseas, VC hunting and PK population are also fascinating, so there are a lot of enjoying, so you can play with confidence, I feel at least less than the Japanese version.   When I was a beginner, I was hunted in the Japanese version ...  So, I think it would be convenient to have both software! ! <BR>  It may be good to divide the rank in the North American version to the robbery, etc. from the Japanese version.  I did this. <BR> * If it is a North American version, people will gather people. <BR> To put it together, there is no regulation → there are many enjoyments → I feel like there are many weirdos (laughs)",4,2,Good
"I've already played GTA V for PS3, so I'm not too concerned about the game itself. The case for the game just bothered me a little. The game disk and manuals were intact, but the clips which hold the manual in broke off completely. In all honesty, it does not seem to be a mistake made by the transport according to the looks of the break. However, I am still pretty satisfied with the punctuality of the delivery. Like I said, I'm not too happy about it, but I'll be just fine.",4,0,Good
I was never big on the grand theft auto series but after playing this I dont know why I was ever so hesitant to play it. This game is hilarious and had me laughing on end through the mission. Not only was it enjoyable but it also had some challenging gameplay and it was very well thought out. It is also gorgeous and I had just as much fun playing the side missions as I had the main story. Its easy to see why this was full price for so long. It was worth every penny.,5,1,Good
Best game,5,0,Good
"It's the same GTAV you played and loved on PS3, with some extras! A couple new vehicles, some new guns, and a few other random things for good measure make for a surprisingly fresh experience. The first person mode can be loads of fun (try off-roading, you can't see where you're going at all!) and completely disorienting at times (fly out a car windshield in FPV once, it's great) plus you now have the ability to save and share all your stupid video clips and pictures! It's pretty great, sell your old copy for $25 on EBay and pick this one up (if you already have a PS4) and you won't regret it. If you do, don't blame me, I didn't say anything.",5,0,Good
"That said, it takes almost an hour to install. DO NOT LIKE.Also, the text is too small. I have a 60"" television but I don't sit right in front of it, I have 20/20 vision with my glasses but the text is too small to read quickly. Please make an option to enlarge the text by at least 50%, there are a lot of complaints out there about the text size. It looks like it was optimized for someone sitting in front of a computer screen, not a TV 8 to 12 feet away.",4,15,Good
Five stars for imagination and reality as ugly as that might be definitely a technological marvel but if you can imagine it on the streets it really is going on in this game parents beware if you can do it on the street you can do it in here,5,0,Good
"Having played GTA V on the PS3 I was expecting the same thing but with a few upgrades. However the picture quality is smoother, sight distance is a lot more in depth, water looks sharper, sounds are more crisp, and you can fly passenger jumbo jets in single player mode. What is not to love. Online is still just as good as on the PS3. It was hard to stay in a lobby on launch, but if all it is doing is disconnecting me I can deal with that. Better than loosing character data like last years launch. So far I am having a blast, can't wait to level up in online and complete the single player again. Worth every penny.",5,1,Good
Nothing about the game is bad it’s the best game I’ve played in years I purchased this game 6 years ago when it came out and it’s still astonishing. The weird thing that happened is that instead of the normal version of gta it gave me the premium version which is good I guess?,5,1,Good
:thumbs_up:,5,0,Good
"More of the same, campaign characters were uninteresting and the inclusion of three different campaigns definitely show how the care and work was divided among the three. If they did just one character the single player would definitely be a lot better. Don't get me wrong its a great game but as a previously avid player of GTA 4, this felt like more of the same and got boring rather quickly. If you have a dedicated group of friends to play it with though then its definitely worth getting, especially now that it actually has some amazing multiplayer options available.",4,1,Good
"This is a great game. The lighting and character models have been improved to a point where it is one of the best looking games of this year. It also now supports 30 person online lobbies which include races, deathmatches, and the heists coming in a 1.4GB Day one update. I recommend this game for everyone if you have played the last gen version or not, this game is a great experience with a pretty much endless replay value.UPDATE: Sorry, heists are not coming out today, 1.18 update was to make gta online works for the new consoles pretty much. What I heard is they will be released a week or two from now. Still a phenomenal game.",5,3,Good

"Good game it was worth buying again not the whole 60+ dollars but for 39 it's an easy buy, but the graphics are great the PS3 and Xbox 360 version were already polished but the new gen versions are outstanding I was definitely impressed. But if you had it on the previous gen systems it's worth buying it again at the price that it's at now which is 39 dollars and the first person view is the main upgrade and it makes the game look totally different it's almost scary lol but it's still fun to play the game again in the upgraded version.",5,0,Good
"This game has a good story, but If you haven't played this, the controllers, are not the best, and if you don't have an SSD, loadings screen are going to take so much time.",5,1,Good
"Much better then Xbox 360 version. I had the 360 version and I couldn't stand the load times. I quit playing the 360 version shortly after picking it up. It took forever to do anything, even the simplest things like entering stores or changing clothes took a long time to load. The graphics and load times are much improved on this PS4 version. The only delay I experienced when the game had to install for the first time. This game is a blast and a must buy!",5,1,Good
"The game play is nearly identical to GTA 4. The controls are clunky at times but not terrible, it's most noticeable in the new first person mode. I nearly ran over a cat but instead I wrecked my car trying to avoid it. I chased a small furry critter into the woods while exploring but I was attacked by a cougar and died. I jumped a car Dukes of Hazard style off a mountain and survived. I tried again and died in a fiery crash. If that sounds fun you may like this game. Also strippers.",4,10,Good

"Great game, personally have gotten more than my money's worth from it. Story mode keeps you interested and gets you used to the game while Online play is a great way to hang out with friends or meet new people. Be wary when playing online for people trying to advance their kill count or just generally troll. Developers often take way longer than advertised for promised content but content included should be more than enough. Overall great game recommended for gamers 18+ as the rating suggests, plethora of adult content.",4,0,Good
"So much to do.  The story is very long, but there's a bunch of other missions to do once that's over.  The graphics impressed me on PS4 and looked so realistic when flying a plane/helicopter.  The water looked real and the lighting is great.  The main characters are great and this is definitely the best GTA game that's ever come out in my opinion.  The online doesn't work very well and takes forever to load, plus you must have a Playstation Plus subscription to even play online.",5,1,Good

Lots of drugs, killing, strip bar time, and swearing here to make you go to confessional after 5 minutes of game play.  The intro and opening scene include a bank robbery with lots of shooting, cop killing, and swearing.  My wife even wonders if I should be allowed to play it and I am in my 40's.",4,1,Good

The city of Los Santos feels like an actual vibrating city. With all this being said, this game is obviously for adults. There is a lot of profanity and sexual innuendo throughout the game. Once you think you're done with the game, there is a number of things to do, especially the online heists which have been recently added to the game. This is a must buy for any type of gamer.",5,2,Good

"I bought this digitally on ps3 on Day 1...its my favorite franchise, so long story short...its the same game but with first-person view and better graphics...the transfer from ps3 to ps4 online was flawless. When i beat the story i will leave a review but the online i give an A...it has its hiccups in terms of staying on or finding good room...but i mean theirs like 40 millions people that have this game i dont expect it be perfect...but nothing happens that makes me not enjoy the game. I would highly recommend and wish you all check it out if your into open world games.",5,0,Good
"People!  Stop letting your 10-year-olds play GTA.  Super fun game, but very adult-themed.  Also avoid the online, its nothing like the single-player game unless you are looking for something different from the single-player game.",5,0,Good
"This game is just as fun as the rest within the series, GTA online is a lot of fun with friends, you guys can set up a private server and play together or you can go straight into the really thing and play with many others, some people are trolls however and will kill you in game multiple times which will frustrate you when you're just starting out because they have more than you, my recommendations is to pay with friends until your character has enough equipment to play by yourself or with friends in the open servers.",5,1,Good
"So what do you do in this game? You steal cars and drive them; you go to night clubs and you watch the characters say sexual and racial stuff and do drugs all the time and you occasionally shoot some people and that's it. The game is rated 18 because of these things but in reality it,s mainly directed to teens who can't do these things in real life yet and want to do them in a video game, because I sincerely doubt that many adults will find it interesting when a video game character goes to strippers club or take drugs.The challenge in this game is 0 besides learning how to get used to the horrible controls of planes, not because your characters are super powered but because the whole games is designed to be suitable for kids and teens who like to enjoy their fantasies without being disturbed by challenge or any sort of obstacles. You have thousands of dollars since the beggining of the game so you have basically unlimited numbers of ammunition, but you wouldn't need any guns beside in certain missions because there are no enemies in the world of this game, just you and unlimited number of civilians to ""mess with"".Buy this game only if you find stealing and driving cars is a fun thing to do, if you want a good challenge with a mature setting then go and look for something else, this game has nothing to offer besides ""cliché-ing"" evreything related to US teens fantasies about gangs and drugs.",1,4,Bad

This is one of the most game I play about every night before I go to bed for work. And times hard to get off. Can not wait to get my new PS4 console in the mail and play this one. If you have never try GTA 5 you should. Try today and see all that online play can bring you and.,5,2,Good
"The game is excellent, many hours to invest in history mode, a huge map and a lot of variety as general and optional missions. The multiplayer is good, it is simply not to my liking since mostly runs below 30 fps (understandable for a game with a map of this size and the detail of the graphics) in addition to that it is quite uncomfortable to use the system of Auto-Aim If you previously played any shooter.  in terms of the package, I came in an envelope just as most game albums, I am not sure if I crushed or hit but the map came somewhat broken , the game was intact and the box also but it is as if at any time sufficient pressure had been applied to the disc box to break the map paper.",4,4,Good

Last GTA played was San Andreas (big fan), this one has a lot of new stuff like playing with different characters and pre-missions before a big job. The only thing that got me bored was the missions where you have to learn how to fly because they are pretty much like the ones in San Andres. Apart from that the game is great for adults.",5,1,Good

We recently bought a PS4. It was originally for my girlfriend since she likes playing the God of War games. I wanted to give it a try since I haven't played on a Playstation since the PS2. I had played GTA V on the Xbox One before and it definitely handles better on the PS4. I still prefer my Xbox One generally but certain games just don't seem as suited for it.,5,2,Good
"This is always a great game to play, especially if you are looking to just kill time.I love playing it with co-workers and friends online! I never do the story mode I strictly enjoy the interaction with others.I wish I obtained the 1.5Mil promo code that my friend got by purchasing it 4 days earlier than I did for online virtual currency in game. That would be cool to still obtain but if not no big deal!",4,1,Good
"I could not be happier, because the request was imported from the USA so it expected it to take at least two weeks to arrive according to the period to start shipping provided by Amazon, however UPS did an excellent job in the delivery, because I received the Package in just a week, that is, in the middle of the time that had originally been scheduled. OK. You have several additions such as the first person camera, graphic improvements, less load time, better textures, more detail, better frame rate, etc. Anyway, if you liked GTA V for your last console and you are doubting whether merits the purchase again, go ahead, you will not regret it.   If you have not had it, do not hesitate, it is an excellent game with a gameplay Imsecable, you will take hours and hours of fun.",5,2,Good

I am not impressed at all by the graphics either, and the story is not compelling. I played Mafia III a month ago, and it is way better than this. The story and characters are compelling, not here!What bothers me the most is that I am not clear on what I have to be doing here, I am not sure how to move from one mission to the other. I may keep it, probably sell it, but I am not giving this more than 3 stars.",3,2,Normal

This game rocks and the online version rocks as well.  It seems that rockstar has corrected past complaints and minor bugs in there gta series. They are always updating the online version as well. I really cant say anything negative or bad about this game. Every aspect of it is awesome. The online version use to chug a little when you drove fast but they have sinced fixed that issue. I played the xbox one version of this game and the online aspect of it was not so good. The xbox one version seemed to skip and stutter alot at times.,5,2,Good
The single player story mode is good. It's very long and you can spend a lot of time cruising around and doing missions. Very addicting and could play for hours. I'd give it 5 stars. The reason I'm giving it 3 is the online part. It's very fun but it's absolutely ridiculous to have to be playing 5 year old kids. I wish somehow Rockstar could monitor the age of people playing it. It's absolutely an adult game and is fun when you get in a lobby with all respectful adults. The 5 year olds make it unbareable. Sure there are its downsides but overall online offers a lot more gameplay. Just get the kids out of it.,3,1,Normal
This is the third best open world game after red dead redemption 2 and witcher 3,4,1,Good
Great game all around had a issue with the packaging amazon refunded me love amazon.,5,0,Good
"Now I really enjoyed the Grand Theft Auto V story and kind of enjoyed the multiplayer but if you already own it on previous generations there's really no need to buy it on next gen. True the grpahical upgrades, and first person modes are cool but I found myself in laggy online mode and eventually got bored of the new effects in about a week. Bottom line if you already bought it don't buy it again, and if you don't own it go next gen.",4,1,Good
Great game. Just know if you want to play PS4 online you have to Pay to Play. This game is a  great game but it is just as good on PS3  I own that one too  and didn't have to pay 49.99 to be able to play the game online. After a year I will have to pay again unless another console is coming out lol  And also PS4 is only compatible with HDMI tvs so if you own an old tv the analog that can't use HDMI be prepared to buy another tv too. Yep. Great game.,5,0,Good
"GTA V on the PS4 will give you endless hours of entertainment. When compared to the PS3 version, the graphical updates are very obvious. The shadow and lighting effects along with dynamic terrain make it feel like a new world.Unfortunately, the frame rate suffers.. It would've been nice to experience GTA in 60 fps on the PS4. I don't think I can justify buying this game for a third time to experience that on the PC. Some aliasing is present, but not nearly as bad as the PS3 version.Sure, the game has its flaws.. but I think it deserves 5 stars.",5,1,Good
"I'm rating this as 5 stars. The dude that lives on the couch enjoys playing this game. I have not played it.I can only assume that this is a good game since the dude that lives on the couch devotes almost as much time to this game as he does sleeping.I do enjoy watching him smash up cars and stuff, for a lot less than it would be to enter a derby or something.",5,0,Good
Just got the game today and it's still great. Got to transfer my character from Xbox 360 and everything was here. My only problem is that the $10 GTA V Bull Shark Card code isn't working. I get an error saying the code may not be correct or may no longer be valid.  I tried many times and it is correct and I didn't try the code until I was in online. Game is perfect which is why I gave it 5 stars and not any less for the card problems. Don't know what to do about this problem though.,5,0,Good
"This is literally my favorite video game by Rockstar other than GTA: San Andreas so of course I had to purchase it once it was released on next gen consoles (and once my bank account allowed me to, haha). Great game! I especially love the fun treats for returning players. I love that Rockstar took the time out to make use of the new PS4 features to give GTAV a new feel with more features.",5,1,Good
"Nice game. Bought it for ps4 bcos my butthead of an ex best friend borrowed my 360 copy and loaned it to another guy without my permission. I am 25 but still find the (Im)Mature Humor to be funny. I had plans to buy a ps4 anyways, soon after I got one i needed a 2 TB hard Drive upgrade bcos each game took up 20-60 GB's plus the online update. (another couple hundred MB's at least)",4,2,Good
"I owned a copy of Grand Theft Auto V for  my PlayStation 3, which I sold to help pay for my PlayStation 4. It was one of the greatest games of all time, and they somehow managed to make it even more enjoyable. The updated graphics are immediately noticeable, 30 player death matches are absurdly entertaining, and first person mode is a somewhat clunky but overall welcome addition that immerses you into the sprawling open world recreation of Los Angeles. The characters are unlikable in the coolest way possible, with witty and hilarious dialogue performed by an extremely talented cast of voice actors.",5,1,Good
"Great game. Single player is amazingly in-depth. Also one of the first few games I have gotten involved with that made me want to find out whom the voice actors are. Even better still they are almost the characters them selves while adds to the depth. Then there is multi-player. Huge sandbox world, up to now 30 players tons of weapons and cards and planed and choppers in with to reign death and destruction upon the unsuspecting citizens of Los Santos. This like it's predecessors will be a classic. As usual it's Rockstar...keep it away from the wee ones.",5,0,Good
Had to return game. The game was in great condition and had no scratches but would not work when my son tried to play it. We tried multiple times with no success. Very great customer service though. They could not replace it with a new one but all we had to do was return it I received my refund.,3,0,Normal
"Great open world game, and nice place to come into the series if you're not familiar. Thought the story line and changing  perspectives between the 3 main characters was well done. Fun to play. But NOT for everyone. If you buy any grand theft auto title you should know that they're about drugs, violence, sex, etc BEFORE you buy. This game is pretty much why they have the mature audiences only rating for games. So be forewarned.",5,23,Good
this game has been out for awhile now. if you're looking into grand theft auto 5 then you probably know what you're getting into and you already know whether or not you want to buy it. this game was recommended by several friends. i waited for it to be cheaper before i ordered it.,5,0,Good
"The overhaul for the new consoles is above and beyond.The sheer amount of content in the game alone is staggering. Online is a lot of fun, but the campaign... Is as close to a masterpiece that the genre has seen thus far. In my opinion, the most appropriate and satisfying finale to any game in the franchise.Now accommodating players that really only enjoy games in the first person, as well. I was skeptical, but it plays great from all perspectives. Doesn't feel shoehorned in at all. Great game. Highly recommended, if you've been on the fence.",5,1,Good
"I had been wanting to buy this game for some time but I was waiting for it to lower it to buy it, since in the PlayStation online store it does not fall from 50 dollars when it is in promotion, so take advantage of the Amazon discount. A small detail, as I bought two things, sent it to me in a box instead of envelope, but even so, in the back of the game box a cut is seen, both the box of the box and the game sheet , nothing happened to the album which came subject, but those little details matter a lot. Because of the game because there is no need to say anything, we all know the GTA saga.",4,1,Good
"Grand theft auto. You pretty much know what you're getting with a gta title a story (usually a good one)An open world And Loads of mayhem, anarchism and general running from and pissing off everyone until the cops/swat/military come to say enough! to witch you respond with a tank.The case was sealed and had all contents inside. The disk was in perfect condition and plays flawlessly.Cons: Party dropouts. (Multiplayer heists require 4 people)",5,0,Good

"If you played any previous GTA games then you know what to expect from GTA V. There is so much to do, to mess around, break the law etc. The story was kind fun too since you can switch between three character at any point of the game except during a mission. I seriously don't see how much more GTA 6 can improve since GTA 5 has everything. GTA 5 followed the success of GTA San Andreas, except the size of the map of Los Santos isn't as big as GTA San Andreas.",5,0,Good
"A classic. We'll leave it at that. Okay I'll say more. The 3 way storyline, the missions, the design, graphics, the city, online play, everything makes for a true first rate title. This game will be talked about for awhile. It's as fun, if not more fun than Vice City was. Where GTA V wins is with the characters. Everything from their voice actors to their storyline and their design. You truly felt the story of Michael. You can feel the guy was a bored and going through a mid life crisis. Just go play it and you'll see.",5,6,Good
Great graphics,4,0,Good

This game is really fun. There's So many things you can do. Its more fun with friends. The reason why I gave it 4 stars is because this game takes a long time to load about 3-4 minutes if you're playing online story mode will load in about a minute or so. I would recommend this game to a friend its really fun,4,0,Good
Good,5,0,Good
"So far I have completed almost 25 % of the game. The game has breathtaking graphics and brilliant storyline.it all looks like as if you are controlling the characters in a movie. You can almost do anything in this game from jacking cars to performing Yoga. The content in the game especially the cut scenes are very explicit and 60% of dialogues have F-word. Take care while playing it with your young siblings. Always be reading to press X to skip those cut scenes. Otherwise overall I enjoyed playing this game, it's just so much fun.",5,1,Good

My husband loved it when it came. We’ve played it quite a fire times and says it was a great buy. Came packaged very well disc was not in place when I opened it but there were no scratches and it played fine. As far as shipping goes I thought it would get here sooner than it did.,5,0,Good
"It was a good price, i got it quick.",5,0,Good
"What can be said about this that hasn't already been said? One of the most spectacular, immersive, fun and exciting games in history. I do think it's a little over-the-top for the first few hours: a little more violence and language than necessary, but the game opens up to be a totally amazing experience and one that almost anyone would find compelling. I drive around all the time just to ""see what's happening"" in the city.",5,14,Good
Best game ever... next to gta iv of course.  Lol,5,0,Good

"Great game and also a wonderful engaging story. The best is also the online play where you get to create your own character and do missions and play deathmatch.The game has a new mode for online coming out soon where you get to pull off heists, just like the main story, but with your friends!The game is huge and with so much to do. The detail, characters and voice acting is nothing short of a masterpiece.This is Rockstar we are talking about, they make great games.",5,0,Good

"Rockstar assigned a real world value to GTA$ when the first game (according to them the only version (last gen)) of the game was hacked for infinite GTA$. This means that every ""free"" update that has required a GTA$ purchase (in case you're an IDIOT--ALL OF THEM) has required an actual money investment to attain access to. CEO, Bikers, ect. have all required, according to Rockstar, a real world investment to gain access to.Want to be in a posse like in Red Dead Redemption? Fork over real cash to purchase an in game biker club or play the game for an equivalent amount of time in order to use your earned GTA$ to buy it...If the updates were truly free, you would have instant access to all content and features as it became available.I'm a bit Draaaank; but, my option remains the same. GTA Online is NOT free because Rockstar has officially assigned a REAL WORLD value to GTA$.ALL DLC IS PAID DLC.In short, Rockstar is no longer trustworthy. DO NOT PREORDER RED DEAD REDEMTION 2.Warning issued. Any money wasted is the fault of the reader--Not me.",2,0,Bad
"Great Game! But I wish there were more tutorials. YouTube is full of tutorials -- but most are geared for the hard-core player. I am a novice and the lack of ""how to"" is sometimes frustrating. It would be nice if GTA or Sony had access to tutorials.",4,0,Good
"This is a great game. I've played most of the other GTA games and this one is really amazing as far as the graphics and game-play. Everything looks incredibly realistic, there are plenty of missions to do or you can just wander around on your own. Some features integrate with the controller too, like it flashes red and blue when the cops are after you and you hear the police speaking through it. There is also an app you can download that integrates with it as well. Really enjoyable!",5,0,Good
On the inside was the downloadable content but it was expired from last year. Needing a code so I can actually use it. I can send a picture also.,4,1,Good
i spend a lot of time on this  game  and have a lot of fun on it  for  people with kids  this game is rated M  so little kids  should be playing this game some adults should either  LOLover all it is a good  game  in the hands of the right people  it's good  game,5,1,Good

"First off, the game looks amazing on the PS4, the graphics, the details, the characters look fantastic. But hopefully I'm not the only one with this problem, I keep getting the error code ce-34878-0 everytime when I play on story mode. I tried every method of fixing and nothing worked. Yet I can't give this game a lower rating hopefully this problem will never happen with a rock star release.",4,0,Good

"The game is every bit of amazing as it was last year. I'm very pleased with Rockstar did with this version of the game on PS4. The visuals are stunning, the framerate is a little bit better, and the attention to detail was giving every little thing. I'm glad that Rockstar knows what they are doing when it comes to making a better port. It was worth owning again and if you never played it before then you will be pleased with this version of the game. Its worth every bit of $60",5,0,Good
"Other than Amazon losing my shipment,then when they found it, it was damaged. no worries they replaced it. the game is by far the best GTA game to date. definitely recommend for any longtime fans or anyone who loves Open World Games with good stories. peace",5,0,Good
Been looking to get it for a while on ps4 and originally had it for xbox 360 (still do) and the price hasnt gone down for over a month (or more). I suggest getting it now and not waiting for a price drop because its probably not going to happen anytime soon. No need to write any facts about the game because everyone knows its awesome! (Btw you can transfer from ps3 to XB1/ 360 to ps4) -if you werent sure like i was in the beginning.,5,2,Good
"I know there's a lot of love out there for this game, but I lost interest after about 10 hours in and I'm surprised I made it that far. Sure, it's expansive, taking ten minutes driving full speed to get for one end of the map to the other. It also has lots of ""mini games"" that serve to distract you from the uninteresting story plot. The graphics are amazing considering the vastness of this open world. So much to like but... But my biggest gripe with this game, and I recognize it's a personal one, is the incessant, tiresome and unnecessary use of foul language. It's like a plague on my earholes. Obviously, this is RockStar Games we're talking about and they're not exactly known for being reserved. But have a little control, please. And it's not like I'm some holier-than-thow prude, I curse all the time. It's just really tough to pour hours into this game knowing that the verbal assault isn't going away and there's no dial or censoring for me to turn it off.I really wanted to enjoy this game. Too bad, looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2.",2,5,Bad
"I'm not much of a gamer .. the last game I ever owned was San Andreas on ps2 ... decided to get a PS4 so I purchased this game on amazon because it was the cheapest place I found.. all I can say is be careful , this game is really good and super addicting . So many games within a game .. shipping was quick, no complaints",5,1,Good
Grand Theft Auto is one of those games that will never get old. And the price I got it for was just a no brainer for me to buy. $14.99 plus Amazon provided a $15 credit for linking my twitch to my Amazon prime account. Just perfect,5,0,Good

Great Game. Definitely worth buying for any PS4 owner (that is old enough obviously due to strong violence etc)  This game was better than I expected it to be and even my wife was drawn into it's plot.  I did not do a lot of side missions or play online but just playing right through the story was very fun.,5,0,Good
Excellent product,5,0,Good
"Good game. Huge improvement in environment details, but for human characters, no improvement from PS3 ver.Also, some missions/ hobbies are really ""killing"" time, and I don't know why I should ""waste"" my time to do those sxxt.I thought maybe I'm not fit this kind of game very well. So GTA V will be my last GTA, but, BUT, I don't deny this is a GOOD game.",4,0,Good
"Bought for my 16 yr old. Definitely don’t recommend for a kid at all. Cussing, references to raping someone, strip clubs, gangs etc. I won’t allow my 16 yr old to play it around my 13 and 11 year old.",5,0,Good
"Would give five stars if I only had to review the single player, but the multiplayer has to tack off a star or two.Simply put, it's too laggy, too buggy, often freezes during load outs. These are issues that shouldn't be happening anymore on PS4 or a game as massive as GTA V. Perhaps putting 30 players in one online game session is just too much.",4,0,Good

I gave a copy of this to my best friend. He called me up 2 weeks later and told me that he hated me because he'd been playing for 2 weeks straight.I say that is some quality gaming!,5,0,Good
"This game is super fun, obviously same concept as the old GTAs but different story line and with the ability to switch between different characters. Now that the price has dipped significantly there is literally no reason not to play.",5,1,Good
"One of the most impressive games Ive ever played. So much detail put into this game! However, there was a ton of input lag that made it unplayable. Thankfully I was able to remedy this by turning the deadzone all the way down and aiming acceleration all the way up in the settings!",4,4,Good
"Great game with good upgrades in graphics and content from the PS3 version. Not sure it was worth buying it full price again though. I probably should have waited until the price came down or there should have been a deal for existing owners from Rockstar/TakeTwo, but who am I kidding it's GTA.",4,0,Good
It is constantly being updated and content is regularly added which is rare in a game that's been out for awhile. The story of the single-player campaign has more character development than a good movie but the online play is bland and repetitive.,4,1,Good
"Loved the story mode, you can switch between 3 different characters with all different styles and attitudes.  Great open world to explore.  Great variety of missions.The online mode is absolutely ridiculous.  Trying to get a private session with just your friends is complicated and rarely works even though you follow what appears to be the correct steps, -play gta online-invite only- seems correct but once you enter that world you start a mission and suddenly you are thrown into a session with a group of ignorant children using inappropriate language and racial slurs, and when you quit the event to try to get another ""private session"" you are labeled by Rockstar games as a ""bad sport"". I'm a bad sport??????? Because I don't want to hear a bunch of kids yelling and acting inappropriately?????????  Also another down side to online mode you are constantly being called on your phone by GTA A.I. about all these different missions its extremely annoying!  The design of the online GTA is just so overloaded with garbage that you can't just invite friends pick missions and play, there are so many requirements that it is no fun to play.",1,8,Bad
I like this game because you can play heist and get night vision goggles and the gear rebreather and the new clothes doing missions and get 100000000 million dollars you have to buy it to get everything including new updates new apartments and new cars get everything and you get shark cards and it 80000 dollers in a shark card,5,1,Good

This game is amazing. When i got it i still got the map which is surprising because this is a old game that came brand-new.

The play control is still horrible at times.  Nothing has been improved except the graphics.  The graphics are great, but they weren't that bad before.  You can transfer a previous online player but you will have to start the single player over.  The game came with a money code for 1million dollars.  500k online and 500k in single player for the character active when you redeem the code.",3,4,Normal

"The game came in a big box and in the best possible condition. The game by itself is amazing, and I got it for about 25-30$ cheaper than I would on the PlayStation Store. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone, it’s a really good deal for this type of game.",5,0,Good
I bought this game because it's a really good game. But when I received it the game case was broken. Looks like my Amazon package was stepped on or something. Otherwise a great game for a great price,5,0,Good

"I bought this for my older teenaged son for his Bday. He already had it on the PS3, but had heard the graphics were better for the PS4.. and i guess there was added content or some type of improvement for the ps4. He says he likes it MUCH better on PS4 and is glad he asked for it.",4,0,Good
You already know what it is if you're thinking about buying it. And if you're an adult who has no idea and thinking about getting it for your kid DON'T! There is WAY too many adult themes and content in here not to mention online is nothing but a steady stream of profanity and death. Great fun if you're of the age and love the series. NOT A CHRISTMAS GIFT for your 6-12 year old unless you want them using some new colorful language at dinner.,5,18,Good

Very good,5,0,Good
This game was an amazing game and i had it for the 360 but i recently got a PS4 and i really wanted it for PS4. Manly because they had stopped the DLC for online on the 360 and i loved online. This a great game and it came on time and in perfect condition and i defiantly recommend getting it.,5,0,Good
This game so far is amazing. There's so much to do. The added first person mode is really fun. Fancy cars are really easy to come by in this one which makes it more fun. I hadn't played GTA in quite some time and this game brought me right back. Rockstar knows how to make an open world game.,5,0,Good

"This is such a good ps4 game! The story mode is extensive with different outcomes according to all the little things you do. Online play is great as well, plenty of mission and activities to play with people from all around, just try not to cross paths with that adolescent kid who's just shooting everyone for no reason. It's really fun to play with friends though, well worth the money.",5,0,Good

"A great game - huge play area, decent missions, lot's to do.  Graphics are great in general but aren't as mind-blowing as expected (but by no means terrible).

had for the PS3 re bought for the PS4...still love it! Few features are different and something is up with the stock.Not near as predictable as the PS3 version but that could be from Updates!Still awesome story line!

EVERYTHING is a good experience. Even if you don't like Sandbox Open World games, you'll definitively like this game since it has a well done story, cheesy enough to be taken lightly but well done to be a movie. Recommended! Also, Trevor is an INCREDIBLE character.",5,0,Good
Included a map of the city. A surprise!,5,0,Good
"What's not to dislike? GtaV is always a boredom fixer. If your not killing pedestrians or blowing up air planes, you're doing it wrong! Graphics are phenomenal and first person mode is dope!",5,0,Good
The characters are creative. Options at the end of a failed mission are improved. The process of making money to buy businesses is ridiculous. No point in using cheat codes for health armor weapons etc.,4,1,Good
"I have played this game before and got to the end of all the missions on PS3. I was hesitant to get it again for PS4. The missions are sightly more complex and that makes it fun. Also, the graphics are so much better than with the ps3 game. I did not think this game could get any more clear, but it can! :)",5,0,Good
Purchased for kids and they loved it.,5,0,Good
"Did i never review this on my list?? oh wow. (Grrr) anyway, No complaints (other than it takes a nice LONG while to download, so give it a good couple of hours. But maybe thats just my system) But other than that, Its GTA lol. Love it.",5,1,Good
Came on time ..Installed with no issues ..No lag in the game..Only thing is the casing came broken but the CD was still in tact and wasn't affected so it wasn't a big deal.,4,1,Good
Great game! Have barely gone through story mode because of all the side quests/extra content.,4,0,Good
I bought  it for someone else,5,0,Good
All GTA gamea have been spectacular so far and this one will definitely not disappoint. Would recommend it for everyone. The characters aren't as rich or memorable as GTA4 but still very great.,5,0,Good
"Way better vision effect than PS3 version. Have Chinese subtitle.Bad news you need to know is you mush spent several hours to install it in your PS4,many G data needs to download, update pack and don't know what files. Download and install,than good thing will come, what a wonderful game it is! Everything fine and beautiful in this version,although I have no complain for PS3 version, but this one is much better.",5,0,Good
Wonderful.  Nice packaging. Just love it,5,4,Good
"I didn't play online, only the campaign mode.  It was a lot of fun, but I preferred the old school ones where you only had one character.  It made the plot more deep",4,0,Good
Excellent,5,0,Good
My absolute favorite game of all time. However modders and glitchers make it impossible to have fun sometimes.,4,0,Good
"I got lost in this game when I started it up. The ability to change characters throughout gameplay keeps everything nice and fresh. See myself wasting many weekends on this game in the future.  Same GTA feel, but improved shooting &amp; storylines. The phone feature in the game and the ability to hear audio at certain times through the PS4 app was startling, but great features.",5,0,Good

"Loved it on the old gen system (PS3), so whats not to love on the new gen one (PS4)?-Plenty of visual improvements over the old version-More wildlife-GTAO safe mode improved to help curb aggravation (like when you want to simply sell a car to make $ and people destroy your vehicle)-Easy import of online character to the new system (though I wish you could make progress on all linked systems)",5,0,Good
"There is no honor among thieves. This rings true with the online mode. Don't bother making friends because they will eat you alive. On the other hand, law enforcement will have fun with the Gang Attack challenge. You can take revenge on gang members with little or no pity.",5,0,Good
It hard to play but you will get the hang of it I recommend this product,5,0,Good
I was given the premium version but I just wanted the standard version,3,0,Normal
"I love this game, it brings all of the old aspects of GTA that we love, but with better character and story development. As well as top notch graphics and realism. For God sakes, when it rains it becomes harder to drive if you don't have good tires! Haha.",5,1,Good
I had to re order this game after mine went missing (nothing to do with amazon or mail) and I'm glad I did. I had the urge to play it and haven't put it down since I received it.  GTA series has always been great and this is no different,5,0,Good
"I'm not huge on the idea of buying a game that I've already played, but in this case it's worth it. Take the aspects from last Gen and imagine the amount of work that came into Next Gen. Everything is greatly improved. The visuals look amazing, the first person is pretty fun and just having the Power of Next Gen has harnessed the greatness of this game. So what are you waiting for?! Go play with your friends",5,1,Good

"GREAT game all around. Compelling story with characters you really come to care about. Soundtrack is diverse and rocks. Gameplay is solid and has the usual nose-thumb at society. The world is huge and open and the graphics are simply stunning. The online game is also a lot of fun, with a big active community of people and continued development by Rockstar with new events and items. Well designed and supported game!",5,0,Good

"If the language settings on the PS4 side are not the language corresponding to the game, the language in the game is set separately, but once the setting is made, it cannot be changed again unless the PS4 account is changed. But a little dissatisfied. If you want to change the language in the game depending on your mood, such as French, Italian, or English, do not only use the PS4 itself except for the language that can be set in North American GTA5 software such as English and Portuguese. You can do it, but don't play the game as it is.   There is no particular complaint.",4,2,Good

"Im not an extreme gta fan but i have enjoyed the games over the years.having bought this game on ps3 and growing tired of it,i didnt bother buying this on ps4 . Graphics just werent enough. Bit after my friend showed me the game, and on top of that the 1st player action,wow...blown away...had to get it .....its a complete new experience ...short and complete thought",5,1,Good

"Worth it, I had it on PS3 but I wasn’t gona buy it for $50 or $40 on PS4 smh got it for $20 and it came in unopened brand new",5,0,Good
One of the best GTA games out of the series to come by. It's freaking hilarious. The script is superb. The music not so grand of a selection. You cant have this game without Trevor. Wonderfully entertaining and lots to do.,5,1,Good
"Well needless to say, my husband's productivity has taken a nose-dive.  Him and a buddy sit and cackle like teenagers when they play this.  It's a little much for me but his playing time is a good excuse for me to go sit somewhere quiet and read a book.  The graphics are amazing and it almost  feels like you are watching a movie full of very, very bad human beings.",5,0,Good
Game has been out for 6 years now and still looks beautiful and has a giant player base fun game for someone looking for something new and addicting,5,0,Good
"I bought this for my 16 year old. It is what it is - NOT FOR YOUNG KIDS! A lot of bad language, violence and drugs. Parents of young kids - please- don't buy this! Otherwise, great seller, fast shipping and will buy from them again! Thanks!",5,3,Good
Great,5,0,Good

So I bought this thinking that I would be getting English - US version but what I think I got is Spanish - US version as you can see it in pictures. It does have English but it would have been nice if they have mentioned it. Plus you will get premium edition not the standard one as shown in the picture. So I will give 2 stars for misleading description of product.,2,0,Bad
"Bought as a Christmas present for the hubbs. Graphics is amazing. Audio, such as dispatch over police radio comes through on the PS4 controller as well as other in-game experience (vibrations, shaking etc.) Very cool. Transaction was straightforward, no hiccups, and got it well before Christmas. I can't comment much about gameplay since I don't personally play it, but it must be good; I haven't seen much of him lately. ;) jk",5,0,Good
"Wonderful remaster of the xbox 360/ps3 version of this great game. The PS4 version of Grand Theft Auto V maximizes the potential of the game by adding better damage, a better frame rate, more map detail, first person mode, and other aspects that were limited by the Xbox 360 and PS3 hardware. The first person mode is also incredible, and in my opinion is better than some first person exclusive games.",5,2,Good
I had grand theft auto for ps3 and decided to upgrade to the ps4 version after I got a ps4. The game graphic 1st person mode and game play made it worth the 30 I paid for it.Overall I am dissatisfied with it. I received the game on time but the front of the disc was completly scratched up. I knew I wouldn't get a brand no product but you could atleast let that been known in the description,3,0,Normal

The Grand Theft Auto series has been my favorite video game because free play is so endlessly fun. There is so much to do and driving around is my favorite. I also love just turning on some cheats and having a go at everyone. You will not get bored of this game.,5,3,Good

Hopefully my grandson can give it a rest.,5,0,Good
"I never thought I was a gta type of person but this game is fun! I spend a lot of time just wondering/ driving around, enjoying the world Rockstar created. I thought I'd give this a chance since Red Ded Redemption is one of my all time favorites. GTA5 is just as impressive.Note, this is definitely NOT a game for a kid, not even a teen one.",5,2,Good
"I had this game for the PS3 and PS4 when they first came out but under a certain circumstance, I had to sell them but they are exactly what you expect a GTA game to be. Really fun and I received it in phenomenal time. I just bought it again for a present.",5,0,Good
"Remember back in the day when Good Morning America said Grand Theft Auto: San Andreas would ruin American Children for playing the game and having access to the 'Hot Coffee Mod'?

Many times I have had to replay a mission or were killed because of poor controls......reason for not giving 5 stars.",3,2,Normal
"I bought this game when it first came out and I still jump into GTA online 2016. Maximum replayability. The first player story mode is one of the best-written games Rockstar has created to this day. If you're a gamer, and you haven't played this game; what are you doing with your life?",5,0,Good

"Bought game for a friend so we could play online more. The online is way better than the ps3 version, because ps3 has sucky servers for some reason compared to ps4. First time we played together I went on to an overpass so that we could get into the same car. He shot me off with a .44.10/10 would buy again.",5,0,Good
GTA 5 is still great in 2019. I brought it for my little cousin. He loves the game. I love it as well when playing online.,5,0,Good
"Excellent, it has online mode with many game options with your friends or alone, the story mode is a jewel because it allows you From mini -games with each of the characters to investments in the stock market to earn more money as well as the purchase of establishments which will make you generate more and more dollars, personally it is the game of the century and will continue to be until its successor comes out .",5,1,Good

"In the Japanese version of GTA, there were too many people who did not do it, so there were no people coming to the job, so I couldn't get started, so if I purchased the North American version, people would start gathering as soon as I set up a job. 。 And there are few PKs, so you can play leisurely.",4,0,Good
Good condition,5,0,Good
"Had this game for 360 and enjoyed it a lot. Great game to play with friends. I was cautious to buy it for the new console, worried it wasn't worth $60. I couldn't have been more wrong. First person playing with 1080p makes this a completely different game. Not to mention it runs much faster, and supports larger lobbies. 10/10 would buy again.",5,0,Good
Love this game. This is the second time buying it but this time for the PS4 instead of the 3. If you buy this game for the online experience which I don't even play much personally then that mode will be a gigantic plus for you.,5,0,Good

There is just one thing....I use to play it on ps3 online a lot! and i used to use the phone internet by wi-fi!, it has 2mb.... and well....ps4 looks like need more speed than that! so i recomend a good internet speed..at least 3 mb...and also need to know something i didnt know...on ps4 playing online is not free! :D",5,1,Good
"A very overvalued game with a huge open world, 3 characters to play and many crazy things to do and discover. Although unlike other titles of the saga in this if it is more interesting to do the main missions in history because many of them are entertaining",3,0,Normal
"Happy since they are unforgettable hours of entertainment that I have passed by having it in my collection, it will make you enjoy as you have no idea. I also bought it for Xbox One but I keep this version for PS4 for me it has better graphics and what I liked most is that control brings a speaker and the voices and effects are heard wonderfully. And every time the police challenges you in command flash red and blue lights. The very fast delivery service for well packed DHL. Thank you very much Amazon I will continue buying with you.",5,6,Good
"Awesome game so far! Took a break to play some other games, but I am always thinking of getting back to this one. Its just so long!So many interesting characters and gameplay elements.  Rockstar just keeps pushing this series forward! The remastered features were well worth the wait (I skipped it on my 360 until it came out for PS4).",5,0,Good

If you never had a GTA V on PS3, you should buy a GTAV on PS4. It's mandatory for people who have a PS4.",5,0,Good
"as GTA goes, this game fails next to San Andreas and other Rockstar titles like Red Dead Redemption. The character are weak, their back stories poorly developed and generally I didnt care about anyone. Not enough side missions or rampages or anything that made previous GTA games playable for weeks.the whole game seemed to be centered around online gameplay and for a story player, this was just insulting and superfluous. If you cant unlock everything without buying a gift card with real money for game money what makes this game any better than Candy Crush? little. very little. I am over the GTA series at this point. I think Rockstar has pushed the game as far as it can go and it is dead.",2,4,Bad
"Great game. Still not Vice City, but still a masterpiece. I would recommend this game to any GTA / open world game fan. I haven't really played online, but spent over 60 hours on the single player. I spent most of that just driving around aimlessly. I'm only about 73% done after finishing most the campaign and most of strangers and freaks.",5,0,Good
I have been out of gta  since ps2 had gta2. I love this game! Graphics and language (foul) are awesome. World is huge! My only upset is it looks like you can't change characters (at least not yet) in story mode. I won't be using the online part of it. Do the characters become available in story mode? Either way I would buy this again!,5,1,Good
"The game was package very good..no dents or anything....The disc was still secure and had no scratches at all....idk if they changed it but I was able to transfer all of my stuff from gta v(ps3) onto here....so I got my level,cars,money, and everything else",5,0,Good
Works perfect and came earlier than expected.,5,0,Good
"In the North American version, the same online characters came out.  And since the data was taken over as it was, it is okay not to start from scratch.  I feel that overseas servers have more people.  Also, are you different? The way the game progresses is different from the Japanese.",5,0,Good
"I normally eschew playing the villain in any game where morality is a choice, so I didn't think I would enjoy this game. However, there is a lot to do that isn't outright violent or ""evil"" and it's great fun to play with my friends and brothers.",5,4,Good
"I originally bought the game, and it was defective. However, Amazon replaced it free of charge.The game is great, and Amazon service was great, too.Gta online needs some work, though. It's amazing, but some things need to be fixed, updated, improved.Story mode is great!! Best game I have ever played; hands down.",5,0,Good

Great game! Got it for my husband as an anniversary gift and he loved it. Game works perfect in his ps4. Great buy.,5,0,Good
The game is great. All of the additions to the ps4 version are awesome. The first person camera is a little to low in the cars which makes it hard to see the road sometimes. Things like windshield wipers can block your vision. Even if you already bought this game for 360 or ps3 it is worth buying again if you like the GTA games.,5,1,Good

"It,s like my dream to get GTA 5",4,0,Good

Great as Usual. THis is the Second time I purchase GTA5. I have over 190Hours in at this moment. Flawless to change characters over to the PS4 and well worth it. The Draw distance is fantastic.

Another great game in the series and if you like the previous games you most likely will like this one too.

So glad to get it without paying over $40. This is exactly what my brother was looking for so yeah. It's perfect !,5,1,Good

The multiplayer is pretty decent, although Sony should probably give Rockstar a bigger share of the PSN money.Here is my complaint:  Rockstar support is the worst support for any video game ever.  In fact, it is the worst support for any product / service ever.Their servers are not always stable, which Rockstar has admitted, even though the support part of the company did not get this message.  Just hope you don't have an issue with them, because they are miserably the worst.Buy and play at your own risk.",1,2,Bad

"I installed the North American PS4GTA5 ordered on March 4, 2018 (Sun), so I installed it. I thought it would take a long time because it was WiFi, and it took about 90 minutes to update the Japanese version in December last year.  There was no need to create a new account to play the North American GTA5ONLINE, so I was able to play with PSID created in Japan. PS PLUS was also able to play in the Japanese version without the need to purchase a new North American version.  In the Japanese version, there is not much experience in the gathering of the number of jobs, but now it seems that the transform race is twice as a prize and RP, but twice. It was a quick job full or one person was not enough.  It is difficult to play without English proficiency, but if you do the Japanese version, the arrangement of the options will not change, so you will get used to it immediately. However, be careful because the decision and cancellation are the opposite of the Japanese version.",5,17,Good

"In the Japanese version, there are no people in the job, so I purchased the North American version of the common server in the world, but I bought it and it was the correct answer! Jobs that do not match at all in the Japanese version, such as racing and hostility mode, will match in an instant, and people will gather immediately.  The most happy thing is that when you host a robbery, you will have all the four people in less than a minute. In the Japanese version, there were many times that I gave up without waiting forever, but that is not the case. I think that the North American version is better for those who do not PK or vandalism.",5,37,Good

"It is my personal impression to the last, but please refer to it if you like.  First of all, I don't like it, but it's an overseas North American version, so it can't be helped, but the textbooks on text are foreign languages such as English. Then the decision button has been changed from a marbot to the battons. In the PS3 version, both the Japanese and the North American version were the same.  Other than that, there are more things I like.  The total capacity of the game software is 55GB, so it takes time to start the game, but when the game actually starts, it is the beauty of the screen that you can understand. I was glad I purchased the PS4 body.  I wanted to play this software and purchased the PS4 body, but I am very satisfied rather than regret.  I would like you to experience the first -person viewpoint, which is an additional element of the Xbox One version and PS4 version. The world view changes.  The reason I bought the overseas version was because I wanted to play an untreated overseas version because the content was regulated. I think it is still worthwhile when the Japanese version of the PS4 version was released.  So, I recommend this software to Yu PS4 users, saying, ""I want to play Grand Theft Auto 5, which has not been regulated.""",5,14,Good

"This game is stupid.  Too much time is wasted waiting for it to load.  The language is chronically profane unnecessarily, except as humor to those under 18 for whom the game is not to be sold to or played by.  The controls are difficult which makes game playability irritating and un-enjoyable. Bought this game only because it was $39.99, however I believe the actual value of this item should and will be $15 soon.  I have played and enjoyed Valiant Hearts (which is free) more frequently.  Bottom line, this game does not live up to it's old reputation and new hype.",1,4,Bad

"First of all, this game is very interesting.  Graphics are almost five years ago, so if you play from now on, you will not be impressed. It takes a tremendous time to play every corner.  Because it has a high degree of freedom, you can enjoy changing the way you play flexibly   It is not operability, the GTA series emphasizes reality, so it runs and stops. Inertia of time  The operation is light and it is difficult to get used to it.  The screen also shoots a bang from a distance that looks like a bean grain from a distance.  The opponent shoots with a handgun even though the enemy is not visible. <BR> The police are persistent, the potatoes are intercepted, but they are killed until they give up, but the commander is stupid  Online is too expensive to buy anything. There are expensive cars and weapons as well as asking mangli or hacks.  And the performance is broken. For example, a pump action shotgun or  this weapon is aiming for the enemy with Auto Aim, and if you shoot, you can defeat the opponent even if you shoot. Where are you heading?  Even graphics are inferior to the current games, so  I think it's okay to be put out in this work that should be put out in 6.",2,2,Bad

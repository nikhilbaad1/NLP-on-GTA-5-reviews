"Just got the game in the mail. Kinda disappointed that it's in Spanish or French, I know neither. Turning it to English (or Japanese) is easy enough, but the maps would have been nice in English. I had this on 360 and as long as it's got all the updated play for PS4 I am happy.Delivery was on time and the game plays well.",4,3,Good
"I like this game, and hopefully, it works good on my ps4, I just bought it. But my only question is why is all the info on the back of the box, the map, the booklets, all not in English??? This happened when I bought this for xbox360 too... It's confusing is there a reason for that???",4,0,Good
"Game is kind of buggy compared to ps3 version. Airplane missions for Trevor stop producing money after 5 or 6 times. Also, game is significantly easier in a lot of small ways. Eg, buried tires at Trevor's airfield are lower, making the buggy missions easier so you don't get high-centered with the buggy. Makes the game less challenging and more boring. Also, the helos give up too easy. More fun to have to shoot them down in order to complete a mission. Starter version.",3,1,Normal

"I gave the game to my nephew Steve believing that an extension for the games was an extension. His parents witnessing Jehovas noticed that his was no longer going when the little one began to wear bandanas and took an interest in rap. Phew! A whole party gift for a 7 year old guy. We haven't had any contact with the parents since, which is why I give 5 stars.",5,20,Good

"SPOILERS!Grand Theft Auto is one of the definitive, if not the definitive, open-world/sandbox game series. The game is notable for the freedom that it allows the player, from minor activities such as playing golf to major activities such as evading not only the cops, but also the military in high-speed chases. Despite this level of freedom in the game, the series is also notable for having a very enjoyable main storyline, because of both the fun gameplay and characters. While I have played various parts of various GTA games (mostly Liberty City Stories and San Andreas), the only game that I’ve completed (and put over 120 hours into, no less) is the latest game, GTA V. Some people prefer other games in the series, but even with that comparison, it is a great game. Aside from having a sh*t ton of stuff to do, there is the engaging storyline, which I absolutely love. I think that because the game didn’t take itself as seriously as other games in the series, I could enjoy it more, especially with Trevor’s character. The gameplay mechanics, especially the combat (mainly shooting and getting into cover) were also vastly improved from the previous installments. So, without further ado, here is my personal list of my favorite GTA V missions.NOTE: I’m excluding Strangers and Freaks’ missions, so don’t expect any Grass Roots or Rampage missions here (although both of those mission types are awesome nonetheless).#10: The Multi-Target AssassinationThe reason that I love this mission so much is because of how quick it is and how it makes you feel very tense, like how even the smallest mistake could ruin it all. This mission is the second Lester Assassination mission, where you must snipe four different targets, all within a time limit. There’s just something great about driving my motorcycle, getting off, sniping the target, and then quickly traveling to the next one. The time limit is also very lenient, so while it did make me feel tense, it wasn’t frustrating. This is a very simple mission, especially with regards to characterization, but it was so fun.#9: The Wrap UpThe opening alone made this worth a mention on this list, as it involves several people pulling guns on each other in a hilarious scene; you have Michael and Davey on one team, Agent Haines by himself, Haines’ partner (Agent Sanchez, who turned out to be a double agent) working with the FIB, the IAA, and even Merryweather. Haines ends up escaping on his own, but Davey and Michael are being quickly overwhelmed, so who swoops in with his sniper to save the day? Trevor! This is awesome because one, Michael and him were not on good terms, so it is cool to see him save the day (predictable, maybe, but still cool); and two, who doesn’t love switching back-and-forth between Michael, who is on the ground taking enemies head on, and Trevor, who is providing cover fire for Michael? Plus, sniping helicopter pilots is always fun, so this mission is a keeper for me.#8: Lamar DownThis mission is great for two simple reasons: firstly, Lamar is a hilarious character – his wannabe gangster attitude is a perfect foil for Franklin’s logical reasoning- and secondly, you also get to multiple ways to confront the situation, just like the last mission. The difference, however, is that you now get two men on the ground (Franklin and Trevor), and get to snipe as Michael. This works out well because Michael’s special ability makes sniping a breeze and Trevor’s rage mode makes gunning down enemies a blast. While Franklin doesn’t have any on-foot special abilities, his determination to save his friend makes this mission, especially towards the end when he is driving him home, have some great character interaction. This is the first of three missions I’ve included that involve all three characters as part of the gameplay, and those are always amazing missions in my book.#7: Fresh MeatDuring the ending of the amazing Bury the Hatchet mission, Michael is captured by Trevor’s competitors, falsely believing that he is his lover and will come to save him. Since Trevor and Michael aren’t on speaking terms, it is up to Franklin and Lester to save the day. Lester helps Franklin find where they are keeping him and thus begins a shootout to save Michael. Most of my favorite missions involve simple shootouts, but I love the simplicity of GTA’s combat; you slide in cover, you pop out every now and then to clip down some guys, and then you move on to the next area. Once you reach Michael, you can freely swap between them and take out your enemies while trying to escape. I think this mission, along with Lamar Down, helps to solidify his status as a trusting and loyal member of the team (which Trevor would be, too, if he wasn’t a psychopath), which I liked (and why I hated the two alternate endings in the game). A simple shootout with two characters is why this mission is great in my eyes.#6: Blitz PlayBlitz Play is just a full-on assault mission where you have Franklin and Michael in cover, shooting officers as you wait for your opening to escape, while Trevor is perched up high with his RPG and sniper, providing cover. Again, the premise is very simple, but I love switching between all the characters. If I want to try to get as many headshots as possible, Michael is my guy, but when I want to blow up cars to help eliminate large groups of enemy, I’m going to Trevor. Franklin doesn’t have a special ability or position, but it is still cool to have a third character to switch to in this firefight. There’s only one more mission with all three characters left and this mission was already fantastic, and it only gets better.#5: MeltdownAt this point in the story, life seems to be going alright for Michael – he helped make his first movie, he is planning his biggest score, and he has his family back in his life. Unfortunately, Devin Weston is still upset because Michael didn’t listen to him and not only scared Molly into accidentally killing herself, but also prevented him from potentially making billions from a business deal. Because of this, he sends people to kill Michael’s family, meaning Jimmy and him must race back home, save his girls (wife and daughter), and take down the gunmen. Once again, this mission is mainly just a simple shootout, but the idea of Michael being in a tuxedo with his own pistol reminds me of 007 and him doing this not as a heist to gain money, but to save his family adds a sense of urgency that I appreciated; this game’s story is mainly played for laughs, but a dose of seriousness every now and then is nice, which is why I liked this mission a lot.#4: The Jewel Store JobThe first heist is one to remember and my personal second favorite of the bunch. While the Merryweather heist has a cool stealth element ending with a bang and the Bureau Raid is cool because you parachute into a highly defended federal building (if you did the roof option), this mission is great because, just like the shootouts, it is simple. You stake the place out, you analyze your options, you get the necessary supplies, and you rob a jewel store. There is very little in this game as satisfying as completing your first heist and seeing those bank accounts reach six digits, possibly seven for Michael. Plus, even though Trevor’s first mission didn’t make it to the list, it is the first mission after this and that was a great introduction for him.#3: Bury the Hatchet:Let’s ignore the graveyard shootout that is the focus of the latter half of this mission, as I’ve already established that I love the combat in this game. No, what makes this mission for me is the character dynamic between Trevor and Michael. Michael, sitting at home being his depressed self, sees Trevor walk in. Although they aren’t on the best terms at this point in the story, they seem to be bonding. However, this eventually turns sour and Trevor leaves in disgust, after finally starting to realize what happened in North Yankton and to Brad. Throughout the entire game, Trevor and Michael have this difficult relationship and this is, in my opinion, the climax of it – it all goes down here. What is also a nice bonus is when you are driving to the graveyard as Michael, you hear a voiceover of Michael’s past self explaining to Amanda why he must betray his friends. Just like Meltdown, this mission offers a small dose of seriousness to the otherwise silly story and just like that mission, I love it.#2: Monkey BusinessThis mission is the definition of cool in my book. Michael, along with Agent Haines and Davey, must infiltrate the IAA to retrieve a nerve toxin and then try to escape without being killed. Easy, right? Multiple components come together to make this mission one of the best in the game: firstly, diving underwater with your scuba suit, slicing your way inside the base, and sneaking around with your mask once again evokes the 007 aura of Michael; secondly, you have a stun gun to zap people and later in the mission, you go full-out with your pistol (or at least, that’s what I was using); thirdly, the first-person mode on the enhanced version makes this mission infinitely cooler. I’m not a huge fan of Call of Duty, but this mission reminded me of some of the better missions in the Modern Warfare trilogy, but with the GTA style – personally, I recommend using first-person mode while having the settings changed to automatically switch to third-person when you are in cover (this lets you experience the first-person perspective while still being able to easily take down enemies in cover). And to top it all off, the mission ends with Trevor returning Patricia to her husband, all while Chicago’s hit song, If You Leave Me Now, plays on the radio. The ending is both the saddest and funniest part of the entire game and that, along with the amazing infiltration aspect of the rest of the mission, is why it is my second favorite mission in the game.#1: The Paleto ScoreThe last mission was the definition of cool, but this mission is the definition of awesome. Sure, The Big Score was also a great mission and provided a large monetary reward, but there is almost nothing cooler in this game than Trevor wearing a juggernaut suit and mowing down (corrupt) police officers with a minigun. The mission isn’t very hard (or at least, it wasn’t for me since I selected Chef as my crew member), but it is the epitome of fun in this series. For the first part of this heist, I chose Trevor for his minigun and rage ability, then the game switches you over to Franklin to use a bulldozer (where his slow motion driving greatly helps), and for the ending part, I used Michael because we were heading inside and his slow motion shooting ability is very helpful for headshots. This mission utilized all the characters, even the crew member, very well, with all their abilities suiting their part in the mission. The intro, where you simply drive to the bank, is also hysterical because each member discusses their first score, effectively making all the members bond. This mission has it all: humor, guns, explosions, great character interactions, and above all else, it is fun. Those are the reasons that this is my favorite mission in the entire game.Thank you for reading and if you don’t have the game, go buy it now (unless you hate games and/or are easily offended)",5,2,Good
"After spending over 100 hours playing Grand Theft Auto 5 and completing everything story and multiplayer wise I feel that it is time to evaluate this commercially huge game. As one of the highest selling entertainment products ever, there are thousands of kids and adults playing this game right now. It goes without saying that Grand Theft Auto titles have become something of a household name due to both notoriety and the fact that they are great games boosted by critics and seasoned gamers alike. As an experienced gamer I have played most of the Grand Theft Auto titles that have been released and I know that my opinion counts in terms of what makes a good GTA game. I want to evaluate Grand Theft Auto 5 as a title and as a stand up to its predecessors, most importantly 2008’s Grand Theft Auto 4, which I and most critics and gamers worldwide agree to be a landmark in gaming (for its time). Also I would like to share some ideas I have for the future of the franchise and what could be possible in another GTA title.Grand Theft Auto games entail sex, drugs, guns, cars, planes, money, robbery, overly flamboyant characters, great humor, good music, I could go on. These are big, ambitious games and Grand Theft Auto 5 is no doubt the most ambitious GTA game yet in terms of almost all of these topics. That is not to say that it doesn’t have its faults, however. I want to start with the negatives of the game and end this assessment on the positives. Grand Theft Auto 5’s biggest flaws in my opinion lie in its graphics, size, story (somewhat) and lack of efficiency in terms of its online features. I want to start with the graphics by saying that they could have been so much better. I’m not one to pick apart a game for not having great graphics, but GTA 5’s graphics are weak compared to a lot of games released for the 360/ps3 generations (the ps4/ xbox one versions as well, although they are certainly better). I understand that it can be hard to maintain good graphics when there is so much to be done and seen in terms of the open world, but I still feel that the games visuals could have been polished a good bit more. Grand Theft Auto 4’s graphics were pretty groundbreaking in 2008 for an open world game, and I don’t feel that 5 has the graphics that it should as a follow up.  Also, I don’t feel that the game world is entirely big enough either. Los Santos and Blaine County together is by no means small, and there is plenty to fill the spaces and to be seen and done in these parts of San Andreas, but I can’t help but wonder why they didn’t do the whole state. San Fierro and Las Venturas? If the ps2 could hold the whole state of San Andreas then these consoles could have done so as well. I would have appreciated a bigger map. The story in Grand Theft Auto 5 is definitely a lot of fun and I don’t want to dog on it too much, but I will say that it trifles in comparison the fantastic story told in GTA 4, which is on a dramatic and creative level so much better. The story is so important to me as a gamer. The missions that I’m doing and the characters I meet and do them for have to be appealing. While the single player campaign in GTA 5 is fun, and hilarious throughout, it lacks the dramatic punch that 4 had.There could have been more to the development of the three playable characters. I’m not saying it had to be as serious and heavy handed as GTA 4 was, and the heists do make up for most of these problems, but there could have been more to the story. Last of my complaints (but certainly not least)  revolves around the online which has quite a few technical problems starting with its horrid loading times. Whether it be going from free mode to a death match or coming out of a game and back in to free mode the loading times are terrible. It takes away from all of the great features and game modes available via Grand Theft Auto online when the loading is so bad. Not to mention the bugs that I encountered regularly while getting to rank 100 online, from glitches to getting kicked out of games and missions before they were over to lobbies being poorly backed up. I know that Rockstar is constantly releasing updates for consoles to fix online issues and it has gotten better but there is still much to do in terms of polishing the online.Despite my complaints for the game, I did and do love Grand Theft Auto 5. I would not have spent the time on it that I did if I didn’t, and now I’m excited to focus on the positives. It was probably the funniest game I have ever played. Throughout the story missions and the strangers and freaks side quests (which are all excellent) I was laughing and most of the characters that you meet in the game are great. One of the side missions in particular surrounding a religious cult called the Epsilon program has probably become my favorite Grand Theft Auto mission of all time, possibly the most creative and hilarious thing Rockstar has ever come up with and that’s saying something. I admired the games ability to keep me entertained from mission to mission classic Grand Theft Auto style by staying so funny and entertaining. This humor a lot of people missed in GTA 4, which I can understand. The three playable characters themselves are interesting and different in their own ways. I liked all three of them, but I will say that psychotic Trevor brought the most life to the game for me. Michael and Franklin are much more sensible and most will find to be the better characters, but Trevor brought originality to the game with his dysfunctional personality that separates him to me as the most important character and the center of most of GTA 5’s best moments. The three character switching was something I was worried about when I found out about it during the development of the game, but it is really well done and interesting to switch back and forth between the three guys. I found myself laughing at what they had gotten into while I was away with another character. The game also does a good job of dispersing missions between them, I never felt forced on one character or that one was being neglected. Cars, guns, and planes make a big return in Grand Theft Auto 5 as well, as many people had missed from GTA 4, which had a lack of variety in these (no planes at all). Weapons and cars are fully customizable with some pretty cool perks. The heists, which are the centerpiece of the game and hold it together wonderfully with well-crafted vehicle (land, sea, and air) bits are all cool and original in their own way. I like the way that Rockstar uses them to draw the characters and stories together, and the setups and finales of the heists are the highlights of the single player game. The online heists that have been included as dlc are a lot of fun as well, especially if you have a good team to do them with. In terms of side quests and things to do in single player and online, Grand Theft Auto 5 is ripe with possibilities. All of the side missions from hunting, racing, rampages, parachuting and miscellaneous encounters are entertaining and appropriately challenging. I had fun reaching 100 percent completion of the game and even the collectible missions didn’t feel like a chore. Getting to rank 100 in multiplayer however I won’t say the same for because it was certainly a grind and with the online annoyances I mentioned earlier a lot was taken away from that experience. There is so much to do and appreciate with the online but Rockstar definitely needs to get to polishing it and making it reach its full potential. Even though I’m now technically done with Grand Theft Auto 5 single player and multiplayer wise, I still find myself playing it regularly. There is so much to be seen in the game that I still feel the need to revisit it. And I think that is what makes it a solid GTA. I think Grand Theft Auto 5 is a great game, and it succeeded in what it wanted to be.Do I think it is the swan song for the console generation and sent off the ps3 and xbox 360 as the best title, however? No, I do not. Do I think Grand Theft Auto 4 was a better representation of the power of these consoles for the time (in 2008) and in turn a better game? Maybe I do, maybe I don’t. It’s hard to compare the two. But, I think fans are pleased because it is a return to form for “Grand” Theft Auto, with so much to do and so much silliness that could never have been found in GTA 4. The fact is that it is amazing that Rockstar was able to create such great games that are so different and succeed with both of them. What direction the series takes next is going to be very interesting, and I can only hope that they find a somewhere in between with the success of these two titles now in the past. I wish for a game with the dramatic punch and technical prowess of GTA 4, with the size, fun, humor and possibilities of GTA 5. Perhaps this could be easier with only one character, and a totally new environment rather than visiting one from a past Grand Theft Auto game. I hope to see the next GTA game have a focused story and characters, with lots to see and do, good graphics, better designed online with less glitches and annoyances, and something new and original. That could be anything from vehicles to characters to missions, which are always great and entertaining in Grand Theft Auto games. But there are still so many possibilities and so much that hasn’t yet been done. I hope to see the next Grand Theft Auto fully realize this and seize its potential and hopefully not only meet the successes of these past two titles but surpass them.",4,5,Good

"What can I say other than this game is one of my favorites in my modest collection of games?I've only played GTA 4 and 5, but the first time I played 5, I admit I was a little hesitant. I had come off right from finishing 4, and my mind and heart were still with those characters in Liberty City, it almost felt fake to come here to Los Santos. I played these games on the PS3, so I played the prologue of GTA 5 and then took a break for awhile. After coming back after maybe a year, my perspective had totally changed. I'd missed the GTA world, and it was exciting for me to try new content. This time I had it for the PS4 and immediately my reaction was insanely more positive. Maybe it was just the graphics that bothered me the first time around, but this time that I played it was truly uplifting for me.The game centers around Franklin, Michael, and Trevor: a small time hustler, retired bank robber, and a deranged, trigger-happy guy respectively, who eventually find their way together and use their criminal cunning to fight for their freedom. It's an open world with a thoroughly engaging story line that had me enticed all the way to the very end. You get to switch between all three characters, doing missions and side quests to further you along the game. It took me awhile to finish my first play through, and when I wanted a break from the main story, there were plenty of Strangers and Freaks side missions to do where you help out (or con out) some pretty interesting people, along with random events that occur around town where you can cash in for a quick buck or play hero to some helpless civilian. My favorites are the collectibles, where you have to collect spaceship parts or letter scraps; finding all of them unlocks a unique Strangers and Freaks mission. Even after you finish the game, there's still plenty to do. I'm currently trying to get to 100% game play and that in itself is packed full of checks you have to get through on the checklist. It's enough to keep you occupied for months.The characters were pretty solid, the main characters anyway. Trevor is by far the most entertaining of the three with his general wackiness and psychopathic tendencies. Depending on your tastes, the events and dialogue centered around him are incredibly humorous and never fail to make me laugh. The graphics and driving are so much smoother than on the PS3, making the driving sometimes sensitive if you're used to the rough turns on its predecessor.GTA 5 is definitely worth the buy if you don't want to finish a game in a couple settings. The world is vast and full of goodies, like armor and ammo just lying around in the woods or underwater, so you can't go wrong there. With the PS4 version of the game, there are perks for returning PS3 players who played GTA 5 on there first, like exclusive weapons and missions. So, even if you already have the PS3 version, getting the PS4 version would not be a bad idea!",5,51,Good
"I resisted playing this for a couple of years. I was annoyed at the way the game started out with a somewhat challenging driving sequence. Additionally, the graphic language and initial characters seemed over the top stereotypical. HOWEVER, I finally gave this another try, recently, and I have to say, this game is fantastic. Yes, they use the ""F"" word over and over again (not a prude, just seems unnecessary), but you actually get used to it.The Good:The ""Los Santos"" or LA open world is amazing. Even though the game is a few years old, the graphics and much of the scenery is really beautiful. If you've ever live in LA, its amazing how familiar it all it. They've compacted the areas of the city, since making it true to size would be unrealistic, but don't get me wrong, it's huge.The driving get easier as you go along. Each car handles a little differently and after a short while of practice, the driving becomes quite easy. In fact, it's a BLAST to drive around the city and desert areas. I never obey traffic laws, and the cops don't seem to bother you for running red lights. It's easy to steal a car and use it when needed. Tons of different models, as well as motorcycles. Driving is a huge part of this game, but trust me, it gets really fun running from cops.This story in this game is amazing. At first, you're wondering why your playing these characters that seem a bit over the top, but as the story progresses, you see how they all come together and it becomes one of the most engaging and fun stories that you'll encounter in a video game. There's tons of side quests to do and hundreds of hours to put into it. You will likely find yourself becoming attached to the characters as you do in any good tv show or movie. Believe me, the characters and morality in this game are quite questionable, but once you realize it's just a game and enjoy it for what it is, then you will have fun.There's a whole money system, property, stock, etc...but make it what you want. Yes, it's good to buy some things, such as an airstrip for one of the characters, etc...but it's simple and you will earn money. However, you don't have to go crazy with it if you don't want to. There's a lot to learn in this game, but it's never a burden. Google is your friend.Bottom line: Give it a chance and make it through the first three or four hours to get to some of the better main missions, and you'll start to see why this game is so popular.",5,1,Good
"To start, I am a Rockstar games fan, especially the Grand Theft Auto franchise. I own GTA V for PS3 and I’ve played my moneys worth and more. In the past 6 months, GTA online has started to go downhill, less people, less DLC, the fading promise of heists online. Even I, as an avid GTA player, has gotten bored with it. When the Next gen announcements came, I wasn't to excited, I figured a few more shiny objects to please the masses. Then I looked deeper. I purchased the game for PS4, and i purchased a PS4 to play this game. There are so many improvements and changes, it is worth $60 more.The Aesthetics, Rockstar is known for detail. The previous gen was very detailed, but the new gen blows it out of the water! The way the grass moves and The rain falls. The graphics are not quite as great as the trailers,  but impressive to say the least. The way vehicles respond to impacts is more realistic. The draw distance Is amazing, You can pick A car's headlight in the distance, zoom in with your rifle and see it the car. There are more people, more traffic,  a variety of weather,  all making for a more immersive experience.New modes and Items, I couldn't possibly cover everything, so I will just cover my favorites. The first person mode Is awesome! Fully functional gauges in a cockpit view is something i've always liked in games, GTA V does it great. Flying is my absolute favorite activity in GTA, I am an aircraft mechanic and though the gauges aren't perfect, I really enjoy this new mode. If you've already beaten the single player,  I suggest playing it again in first person mode,  it's well worth the time.  Now I did own the previous gen, so I recieved a few extra things for upgrading,  the rail gun and the modified Duke. All insignificant extras,  but it was nice to have some extras thrown in for the players that upgrade.The online: I was concerned that upgrading and transferring from my ps3 to ps4 would have issues. The transfer was smooth and easy.  All vehicles,  weapons and items transferred just fine for me. The limit is still two properties,  there was a rumor a player could own 3. Unfortunately not.  The collectors edition items such as the carbon RS,  Hot Knife,  and Bullpup shotgun are now unlocked for everyone.  That's somthing I've been waiting a long time for. Unfortunately,  I was hoping for animals in gta online,  but that isn't a feature,  maybe in future updates.  Rockstar has also promised heists to be the first update,  but that promise comes with allot of warented skepticism.My verdict: If you couldn't already tell, I liked it. Its not just the common re-release, It improves and adds to the already great experience. Its well worth another $60 if you've owned it before, and if you haven't played it yet, You're missing out!",5,148,Good
"When this game originally game out I never played it. I knew what the GTA franchise was, and how well made their games were, but I never tried any of them for myself. Well come this November, many great games launched, and through the persuasion of one of my trusted friends, I bought this so we could play online together, I figured if I didn't like the game I would return it. When I first started up the game, I was met with a lengthy download patch, and after that it was off to the game. Since theres a lot of stuff to cover from a new comer's point of view I'll break my review into sections.Graphics - For Returning players this is a huge selling point, and the game definitely looks good. With its densely populated beaches, and heavily vegetated mountains, this game stands up. Its not the best looking game on the ps4, but its far from bad looking. The only gripe I have with the graphics are some muddy textures when getting up close to some things, and some hard to notice, but still there, pop in.Gameplay - This shouldent be to much of a surprise, but this is still the same game. Cars handle great, far better than watch dogs. Gun play is smooth, however, when in the first person view, there is a bit of delay when turning. This makes it hard to aim with out Auto Assist, this is a fairly big complaint, especially since many returning players are wanting to play this game like a fps. The mission structures differ with large variety, so much so its shocking compared to most other open world games. You never know what your going to do. You may end up pulling down some rich Mexican ladies balcony, to blowing up redneck's trailer homes, to even riding motor cycles on trains.Sound - From what I have played, the sound gets the job done. The sound of police sirens, and Grenade launchers causing huge explosions is definitely good, especially with a head set, however nothing really stood out to me.Story - I wont spoil anything, but the game's story fallows Micheal, Franklin, and Tevor. I found Micheal's personal story to be the best, but the characters are just so widly different, its easy to ensure that your favorite will differ from mine.All Around this is a good first try of the series, and it definitely makes me want more.",4,1,Good
"Nothing helps me unwind after a long day, like killing people on GTA 5. I'm a long time GTA player. Each game is somehow better than the last. Not just the story lines but the graphics.I initially had this for PS3 but recently upgraded to a PS4. Of course, that meant I had to repurchase my favorite games (which I wasn't thrilled about). Fortunately, it was well worth it. The graphics are insanely better! Plus, there are far fewer glitches and i've yet to witness any hacks (like people randomly blowing up everyone in the same room).Online game play is the reason I repurchased this. After beating them games a long time ago, I haven't felt the need to replay it, but the inline stuff is a lot of fun. With the PS4 version, you have MUCH more content! For instance, they have online challenges that are open to all players in the same room/lobby. A favorite of mine is ""Kill the Beast"". You're either the beast (who looks like Teen Wolf), or someone who is hunting the beast. It's quite challenging, as the beast is much stronger than your average player. It takes more effort to kill him. Plus, he isn't visible on your map for long periods of time. You can only see his purple blip, when he visits a landmark (which is the goal for the beast - to visit all landmarks before being killed). If you manage to kill the beast, you're rewarded with a nice chunk of change. The last time I killed him, it was over $12,000 earned. Woot!I definitely recommend playing with a headset. It's so much more fun. I keep my mic on while I play, to (playfully) tease other players. If you hear someone yelling 'Falcone-ayeeeee"", that's me (and i've just killed you).Long story short, this is a must have for all gamers (who are at least 18 years of age). Seriously, DON'T buy this for your kids. The language and some of the scenes are quite vulgar. It's fine for adults but I can't tell you how many times I've had my headset on, and ended up talking to 9 year old kids. Not cool. This is not age appropriate (especially with some of the hateful things that other players say).",5,1,Good
"This is easily the most entertaining and fun game I have ever played up to this point. I'm going to focus my review on the single player portion of the game since that's where I've had most of my game experience.GTAV has it all, action, adventure, drama, comedy, suspense. The missions are well spaced, so starting a single mission doesn't force you to devote more time than you want to during a playing session, but leave a satisfaction of getting something accomplished and the story moving along. There is lots and lots of side missions, entirely optional, but highly recommended solely for the entertainment value.One of my favorite scenes in the game played out during a side mission, a pretty basic one where I had to beat up a guy, I guess I could have killed him too but I wasn't feeling murderous at the time, and run away from the cops after they get called. Pretty basic. Well the car chase that ensued got a little out of hand because I got lazy with my driving and pretty soon I had a huge line of cop cars behind me. I started to dodge the the cops that tried to ram me off the road and the ensuing cop cars flying over my car, over other cars, across everywhere and into trucks was glorious. The amount of destruction caused by police in that car chase was incredible.Being able to watch the replay of that scene was even better thanks to the Share button.This game is full of unexpected sequences like this one and they can happen at any point. There are very few missions where your goal has a very linear approach. The vast majority of the time you have many different ways to approach a situation. No wrong way really. If say you're attacking a compound you can go in guns blazing, snipe the whole place out, or blow it up with grenades, the choice is yours. You can even get the bad guys after you, jump in a car, and run them down if you want to.If you're any kind of gamer, buy this game.",5,2,Good
As good as it was when they just released it.  Top class game :video_game:  a must have for older gamers.,4,0,Good
"This game is a lot of fun to play. It has enough new concepts and events in the game to keep you coming back. The storyline is so-so, the graphics are pretty good for GTA and the map is actually pretty large. The game mainly follows 3 characters around. You have Franklin who is a low level gangster like character in the city. You have Michael who is an ex criminal currently in witness protection living in the ritzy part of the same city as Franklin. Then you have Trevor who was one of Michaels accomplices and who is hiding in a small town in the desert to the North of the city. As you play, the 3 storylines quickly get intertwined together. Several missions center around the 3 characters being coerced into working for the Federal Bureau (like the FBI) doing their dirty work. In the process, you get to rob several places such as jewelry stores, weapons locations, etc. There are enough side quests and activities to keep you busy for hundreds of hours of gameplay and there are countless places to explore around the map. You can control pretty much every vehicle you find from submarines, to tanks, to choppers to normal cars. You also get the option to buy businesses around the map to add additional revenue to your characters. However, it will be a long time before you make your money back from said businesses. My final thoughts center around the stock market in the game. This stock market is pretty complex but just like the real world, it is affected by events in game. You can invest in a companies stock and then you can go and shoot up the competition and your stocks will rise in value. The market reacts to bad things and you ARE the bad thing. Overall, this game is solid and well worth the $40 I paid for it.",4,5,Good
I ordered this like a few days ago and it came with premium version even tough it didn’t say it was premium but I didn’t really mind it I had so much fun playing the game!,5,0,Good
"GTA V steals everything. Heists (from Heat), music (from every action flick ever), FPS combat (from Max Paine), and many, many hours of my life. The story may not be perfectly original, but its about the moments. After a few major missions, I popped back into my car the radio was playing a seemingly tailor made musical cue like ""Something in the Air"" after a heist, or ""Danger Zone"" after an aviation mission, and I found myself thinking, did the designers plan that? Or was that the channel I left my ratio on? The answer, I think, is the latter, but the catalog is so well curated, they all work.Much has been made about the FPS view of the Next Gen version, and, yeah, it gives the game a profoundly different feel. Sure, it's nicer for combat, but the bulk of the game is driving or walking, and it's not ideal for those. You can set it up so that you drive in 3rd person and shoot in 1st, but I found myself always switching back to 3rd person even in walking. It's the added detail, though, that mark the biggest improvements in the game. More vehicles, more people, more wildlife, all acting out their own little AI fantasies. San Andreas comes alive, and you're there, in the movie.It's definitely the most filmic GTA, and while the three characters are a little flimsy, the ability to switch from one character to another mid heist does change the dynamics. Even though the characters may be cutouts, though, the writing is loads of fun. By the time that Michael's explaining to Trevor how he's the original hipster, I was sold.My favorite GTA since Vice City, and my favorite game of the year, even though it's last years game.",5,0,Good
"I won't delve into the details of the game. It's been discussed so extensively elsewhere, it would be a waste of time.Bottom line: If you've never played this game, you need to grab it if you own a ps4 or xbone.  It's a must play game if you are mature enough to handle it.If you owned the game on a previous gen platform and loved it, it is absolutely worth owning again. The improvements make this game a silky smooth experience. Finally the graphics and visual presentation are a match for the incredible sound design and voice acting in this game. It is a sight to behold. The improvements really make this feel like a living, breathing world to explore. It's hard to explain, you really have to play to understand.I don't particularly like first person mode. It's nice to be able to switch to it on the fly if I want, but it's a bit jarring at times. It makes driving a little nauseating and feel even more unrealistic than it already was. In certain combat scenarios it helps to switch to first person, but in most cases I guess I'm too old school and revert back to playing it the way that's familiar to me. Some will love it, others will avoid it. That said, it is certainly not the game changer that it was touted to be in my opinion. It's a nice option, but it is not essential and certainly isn't the number 1 reason to play through this game again. The reason to play through it again is that it is the definitive version of one of the best games I've ever played and the level of immersion is unmatched in the genre of open world sandbox style gaming.",5,2,Good
"This was my first time ever playing any of the GTA's... and what an impact it had on me! I was introduced to video games in the Atari era... at that time, we had to actually rely on our imaginations to experience a real ""adventure"" playing video games. After a long hiatus without playing video games, I fell in love with Doom on the PC... It was a whole new world to explore, but still very limited. Again, after a few years away from video games, I got a last gen console, and GTA 5. It completely blew my mind. The missions are fun, the driving around, shooting (except from moving vehicles - the only problem with it), flying... it's exhilarating. The fact that this huge world is completely open and free to roam around at will is just incredible, and a lot of fun. Sometimes I just want to climb a mountain and take in the sights... and other times, drive around causing lots of mayhem. The changing in weather, the day/night cycle make it a lot more interesting. Walking around, one can hear a multitude of sounds, from the wind, wildlife, people talking, vehicles... it's just amazing. Every time you log on to it, you can just roam around to relax, or engage in a serious mission... it's your choice. If you see something going on, like someone asking for help, by all means stop what you're doing and see what happens... it's always a lot of fun.Other people have told this already, but it's always good to remind: DO NOT  give this game to your 10-12 year old as a gift; it's intended for adults only, really. Lots of violence, sex and some torture scenes inside. It's very realistic.",5,7,Good

"Best Open world game i have ever played. Lots to do, some aspects very realistic, Rockstar finally fixed the police and made them an actual threat to players. From swimming to basejumping, From robbing people to racing there are endless possibilities to this game. Campaign is not linear as their are side quest to do and alot of side missions allow for hours of single player fun and exploration. Multiplayer is riddled with your average hacker but with constant updates rockstar blocks these hackers and helps clean up the online gaming experience making it one that i truly enjoy and have lots of fun playing. Rockstar SocialClub allows players to make specific races and set up missions and races for players to partake in with friends and even if you don't have friends to play with it allows invite random people online or players with a similar skill set to yours to make online play enjoyable and fair all around for players. With many different ways to earn money players are set to doing missions repeatedly but instead can rob stores in the actual free roam and do special events going up against other players or AIs to get money and have a fun time. I have at least 2000 hours invested into this game. The game came in a new casing, well packaged and ready to play the moment it got here. Overall a great experience and I await Grand Theft Auto VI",5,0,Good
"This is quite possibly the best game of the year behind the Last of Us remake.The graphics are significantly improved - at 1080p with the revamped textures and effects this game outclasses some new generation titles. In particular, the rain effects are dazzling and surpass what was attempted in Watch Dogs. When driving or walking in certain bushes or grass, the grass bends creating a realistic action effect. Little touches like that including improved fog and other effects make this game graphically great.The controls are unchanged but a few button mappings. The first person view mode is incomplete. It is interesting, but it isn't as robust as a first person shooter featuring duck and cover (for example, the camera will always pan back to forward center in first person and I've never played a first person shooter that did that). My only complaint is that the range of motion isn't exact enough for my likely (kind of feels like the range of motion from Super Mario 64).Additional music has been added. That is a plus.The frame rates are steady for the most part except in rare instances in heavy traffic - I don't understand why there is slow down because I have played in instances where there are literally 30 to 40 vehicles on screen but in situations where there are 20 cars the game lags a bit. It isn't distracting and infrequent enough for me not to bother.This is a must purchase game for any PS4 owner.",4,0,Good
"Dear Rockstar Games,I just wanted to take a minute and thank you for not being a greedy company like EA games. With EA games, you're basically buying a quarter of the game and to unlock the whole game, prepare to see them all in downloadable contents (DLC). EA games also releases a ""new"" game yearly with same old recyclable materials. If Grand Theft Auto V was created by EA games, it would probably be titled Grand Theft Auto 2019 and have about one every year by now. Every costume will be DLC. SO with that being said, thank you for providing us with such an amazing game for 60 bucks.As for the game, you can expect everything and more in a Grand Theft Auto game. Amazing story, amazing gameplay, amazing graphics, and so much more! The game also comes with Grand Theft Auto Online with support for 30 players and 2 spectators. Both the online version and the single player story mode are incredibly fun and you will get so much value out of your money! Highly, highly recommended!Value 5/5 *****. Gameplay 5/5 *****. Online Gameplay 5/5 *****. My Recommendation 5/5 *****.",5,23,Good

"I've been a fan of the GTA series since Day One on the original Playstation. GTA V was no different when it originally came out on PS3, as it was a day one purchase for me as well. This game has, in my opinion, the best story line of any games in the GTA series. There are a few upgrades in the PS4 version such as different weapons, environments, animals/'wildlife, vehicles, and most notably, first person mode. While I'm not a big fan of first person mode, there is a trophy for it if you play the game for so many hours in first mode, so there is a small incentive to using it.As far as previous game data transferring from PS3 to PS4, the ONLY data the will transfer is that of your online character. So, if you're hoping that your single player/story mode progress will cross over, well, don't set your hopes too high. You will need to start completely from scratch when it comes to story mode, which isn't necessarily a bad thing for holding replay value.So, long story short, this is a great game, yet again, with updated graphics for Next Gen goodness as well as other little perks here and there. I highly recommend it for those who enjoy the GTA series and even those who are new to it. However, parents, please do NOT let your kids play this as the language, violence, and general tone is NOT for kids by any means.",5,0,Good

"generally i never got too into the GTA games after San Andreas, mostly because they got too dark and too gritty and felt like a bunch of recovery missions. also i am a terrible videogame driver.this game stars off slow, until you get into michael's storyline and then it just really picks up and becomes really enjoyable (sorry franklin, you're just kinda boring). i live in LA and this is just a brilliant piece of satire as the city is clearly as much a character in the game as franklin, michael, and trevor...maybe moreso than franklin since he was kind of boring.the best piece of advice someone gave me about this game was to not stress out about driving well, and that made all the difference in the world. now i just crash cars and loot buildings and have a great time. the online multiplayer, at least on the PS4 is sort of meh in that it's really slow and sometimes parties just break up (which is a bummer when you're playing a heist) but the story is great and funny and gross and horrible, the characters are for the most part really well fleshed out and multidimensional, the graphics are top notch...it's a fun game, which i think is important to stress since some games out there, that i still love, feel more like tests of endurance (yes bloodborne, i'm looking at you)",5,1,Good

"If your hear you already know...... This game is so much better than the PS3 version its attrocious. Felt like i was playing a whole new game .Pro Tips on switching your account :  Make sure you have a PlayStation Network Account and PlayStation Plus membership.  If you’re transferring to the PS4 from the Xbox 360, make sure your Rockstar Social Club account is linked to your Xbox Live account and your PlayStation Network account. You can check here.  Start GTA 5 on PS4 and log in to PSN.  Select GTA Online from the pause menu.  You are now given the option to transfer your GTA Online character and progression. You are also given the option to change the appearance of your character with the new creation options.  When you agree to transfer your character all your RP, money and rank of your character will be displayed.  If you have character data on both the PS3 and Xbox 360 this is the point you must choose one. You can only transfer one save from either your Xbox 360 or PS3 over, so choose wisely.  Once it’s transferred over you’ll be prompted to choose a character and away you go. Welcome back to GTA Online!",5,1,Good

"Probably one of the greatest games ever made. Outstanding graphics and exploration options by foot, car, boat, helicopter and jets. The plot is very well written and very interesting. This socio-political satire of the American way of live is quite accurate and does a great job of blending humor and realism in a very tasteful way. This game has a little bit of everything whether it's driving from the very urban setting of the city to cruising along a beach or stock car racing across the vast and open desert. This game lets you take the reins and lets you make the decision, whether they be to shootout a liquor store with the police responding or participate in a triathlon. The options and decision for this game are endless as we explore the rooted lives of our three interesting protagonists as they adventure onto a collision course with gangs, government forces, private security and their own unique ties to one another.The online portion of the video game offers a similar experience with your own created protagonist as you explore the map and do missions and just have fun with your friends or new people you meet along the way. GTA Online is an ever expanding world that changes and offers new experiences to the players: the funnest online I have ever encountered.",5,0,Good
"I must have spent over 1000 hours on this game. Online mode is highly addictive and very fun.The story is very good and has multiple endings. Your choices will impact the game's finale and the heists are a lot of fun. They are all different, varied and add a lot to the game mechanics. The story was gritty and the three characters are really diverse and have interesting backgrounds that many could relate to. The whole city is blossoming with interesting places, people and many easter eggs. It is almost impossible to see and do everything that has been put into this game.The online heists are even better, as long as your team mates can follow instructions as most can't. The game focuses a lot on microtransactions for online items as they are so expensive that casual players cannot boy them. If you have a good team for heists and activities then you can earn a lot and quickly. But finding  a team through matchmaking that will communicate effectively is very rare.",5,0,Good
"I upgraded from PS3 and the game itself is different. You can do fps or third person on the ps4 version. There are more avenues of game play and the graphics are better.That being said, I had to purchase the game which was a downer as I had hundreds of dollars and hours into my PS3 game. I was able to transfer one character but the rest I lost. I had to pay for a new game because the downloadable PS3 version can not upgrade (seems silly) even tho I had 4 downloads available. There is no discount price AND you have to pay to play online on a ps4. I'm the end, this was why I upgraded to a ps4 and to be honest, it was not worth it on its own. Rockstar seems more worried about sales than retention of long term players. That is unfortunate. The game itself, amazing without doubt. The creator, seems a little money grubby. I played right into their hands tho, and I paid the money :shrugs: l hope I can get into playing it so it can pay off.",5,4,Good
"I have played several of the GTA installments and have spent hours upon hours playing them, but I eventually grew tired of them and lost interest.This one is different, and for a couple of reasons. The 1st reason is because it appears that Sony finally has utilized the PS4 capability developing on this platform.The realism is remarkable. My wife saw my character by the beach and literally recognized where I was as she had been there when she lived in LA. The cracks in the highways, buildings, I can go on. The character interaction and activities is like a real world simulator.Next is that they have multiple characters that you play as separately that all have special abilities, personal lives that are all intertwined at different points of the game.Next are the missions. The missions never get boring and repetitive because the developers took their time and made sure that no details were left out. Example, like the handling of the dual sport motorcycle that was in the “Italian Job” like jewel heist, the cop chases, shootouts, reconnaissance missions, triathlons, strip clubs,  I can go on and on.This is definitely a consideration for game of the year.",5,2,Good

If you're adult and can tell the difference between real-world violence and virtual, then try this game.  You'll be pleased!Personally, I spend about half of my time in the game flying.  There are many different planes, jets, and helicopters to cruise around in.  I happen to own all of them, and as soon as you crash one -- you can call in another.Seriously, I can't say enough.

Please don’t buy this game for kids, but as an adult there are a lot of fun things to do in game besides actual missions. Personally I like italics the feature where I can take any car in game which relates similar to most actual car models and upgrade them in various ways to see how that car would look. This helped me figure out what colors to paint my car",5,0,Good
"The only GTA game I've played all the way through was GTA III for the PS2 when that first came out. I've always made it a third of the way through on other GTA games, but there was never enough there for me to feel like I needed to finish them.That being said, this game will soon be the second GTA game that I've ever played to the end. The story is told at a great pace, giving you time to get a better sense of each character that gets introduced. The mission objectives and mechanics varied greatly enough to keep me wanting to go mission after mission.The gameplay is awe inspiring. It appears that they've put a lot of care into each game mechanic, unlike previous iterations. It feels great because now it truly feels like an open world with no limits. The transitions between gameplay, cutscenes, and entering building interiors are now seamless leaving no break in the action.Tons of fun. Definitely recommend this if you have ever enjoyed a GTA or GTA-like game. Even if you haven't, the technical achievement of the game itself is something to behold.",5,11,Good
"Awesome game. Best game graphics ever. Extremely long and fun campaign, one of the best &amp; longest game campaigns ever. Wild and crazy gameplay. Also has good humor. GTA 5 sets a new bar in video games and puts most other games to shame. GTA 5 contains massive content &amp; value, whereas most games don't. Rockstar North creates games for the love of creating great games, unlike companies such as Electronic Arts, Bungie, and Activision, which make games mostly to cheat &amp; exploit consumers for profits. I just finished the GTA 5 campaign and I am extremely impressed, as much as I was extremely disappointed and angered by Bungie's horrible game, Destiny. GTA 5 proves that gamers still love great single player campaigns. The real reason many people skip the campaigns in the Call of Duty games is because they suck! I love the zombies mode in Black Ops II and Advanced Warfare, but the campaigns failed to grab my interest and I didn't finish them. GTA 5 reminds me somewhat of Fallout 3 and Fallout 4, because there are many interesting characters, humor, and side quests.",5,1,Good
Grand theft auto five is definitely a great game. I already had the game for the Playstation 3 platform so I had to get it for for the Playstation 4 platform as well. Rockstar Games did an absolutely amazing job making this game. The graphics are very impressive in this big open world game. So much detail that it's almost life like. The story mode is great because you are playing as three different characters that you can switch between. I have to say that Trevor is my favorite character because when switching to his character you never know where he is going to be on the map. The missions are fun and can actually be quite challenging. The online play is also a big plus for me because all of my friends have the game as well. This game is definitely the best of the Grand Theft Auto series. This game gets a 5 star rating and  two thumbs up from this gamer. Thank you Rockstar Games for doing it right.,5,0,Good
"I see a lot of 5 star reviews and a lot of trolls with 1 star reviews so I thought I'd weigh in, I've been playing my copy for a while now and I had the Xbox 360 version as well.  The key difference is appearance and boy does this game look great, everything is sharp and bright and it's really a pleasure on the eyes, after a while the 360 version would hurt my eyes due to a low resolution and framerate drops.  Secondly this game has a 1st person mode, it seems kind of neat but to be honest I prefer using 3rd person and the feature feels kind of tacked on, I'm not saying it's bad but it's not as good as everyone is making it out to be, overall this is a re release and it's great but my biggest issue is with the framerate, at 30fps it doesn't feel as smooth as it should but nonetheless it's a great game and worth the $60, I'd give it a 4/5 on the ps4",4,2,Good
"There is nothing more entertaining than leading a reckless, criminal, and frivolous lifestyle in one of the most disturbed cities in ""America"". Obliterate police cars by the dozens, sky-dive out of a fighter jet, abuse a stripper, and simply wreak havoc in Rockstar's fantastic and realistic interpretation of Southern California. Swear words litter the script, graphic images surprise viewers, and the pure freedom of the game is shocking. Parents who are buying this game for their children should definitely do this. Despite being able to slaughter masses of pedestrians and visit ""Gentlemen's clubs"" the real life aspect of the game aids in decision making, important values, and freedom of action, something many kid's don't have access to. All the malevolent activities you can participate in while playing, are quite irrelevant to the realistic things you can do. Scuba diving, flying planes, and trekking through the wilderness are just a few things that make the game absolutely brilliant. Bottom line: GTA V is an amazing video game allowing one to do whatever they want, weather that is robbing a jewelry store or flying through the beautiful city sky.",5,2,Good
"This game is not without it's flaws. But given it's scope and ambition - after some pretty major initial glitches - is second to very few other games.Single player world is more alive, more detailed, and interesting (collectibles, characters, vehicle variety), compared to the online mode.The worst to me about GTA is the awful online community. Unless you have friends or meet people elsewhere, like on reddit or such, you're bound to be annoyed by the online free roam.There are a gazillion online jobs, and still to this day, many people host the same few jobs because they pay out the most. Because of the need to earn in game money to afford cool gear, the online community is obsessed with playing high paying jobs. This is totally against the spirit of the game design, unfortunately.I wish the developers of this ""most commercially successful entertainment product in history"" (Businessweek)  would have paid more attention to the interplay between gamers, and worried about how to interact with one another, instead of the enormous size of the map. Games like Battlefield allow gamers to communicate effectively for a lot of basic things, like ""get in the car"" or ""follow me"", because one thing in online gaming is guaranteed: if everyone has a mic, you hear more background noise than actual people speaking. Judging from the consistent lack of mic users even on new gen consoles, I'd venture to guess that the majority of online gamers dislike hearing a random person yell expletives at them all day. Which is, unfortunately, all to common in this community.",3,8,Normal
"Well worth purchasing again. This is the way Grand Theft Auto was made to be experienced. Incredible visuals and exciting new features bolster this epic title.Personally, I love the fact that I can transfer my character from platform to platform. That shows that Rockstar respects the gamer and all of the progress one has made. Let's be honest. GTA V, from the beginning, has been a journey. We have waited long enough for heists. We dealt with the balancing of the online economy which ultimately resulted in many users wrongfully losing in-game currency. We moved on to next-gen consoles, but continued to come back to the older systems just to play GTA, which pushed the current-gen consoles to their max.If this is your first GTA, buy it. I feel sorry for you missing out on Vice City, San Andreas, and Liberty City, but better late than never. If you've taken a break from GTA, come back to this series. If you bought GTA V for PS3 or Xbox 360, buy this again. You won't be disappointed.",5,1,Good

"I played GTA V on the Xbox 360 when it came out.  I created an online account and enjoyed the online game even though it was buggy.  I didn't buy GTA V for the PS4 right away.  I waited a bit and bought it.  I liked how my online money and items transferred from when I played the other version.  The single player game did not transfer over, so you will have to start from scratch for the single player.  The game is beautiful and fun.  If you enjoyed the GTA games, you will enjoy this one.  The graphics for the PS4 are better then what I remember from the 360 (which they should be).  Rockstar didn't just port a PS3 or Xbox 360 game over to the next gen. They worked hard at making it a better experience without creating a new game.",4,2,Good
"This is a good game. I should say that the last GTA I played was San Andreas and I was frankly somewhat disappointed to play this game as I had very high expectations after hearing nonstop from my friends. Yes the game has significantly better graphics and the gameplay consists of playing 3 different characters in the same game which was new to me.My biggest disappointment was that the game ended very quickly. San Andreas had a lot of missions that involved a wide array of activities that were crucial to complete that game however this didn't have much of that. I finished the game in less than 20 hours so was a little disappointed.All in all, it's a good game but I know that Rockstar Games can do a lot better with the storyline",4,1,Good
Yes,5,0,Good
"I have this game on the PS3 and up till yesterday played the game almost every day on that system. This new version though is a masterpiece! I have not yet tried transferring my online character. But playing as Franklin in story mode last night for a couple of hours was awesome! I found myself starting random fights in the street in first person mode just to do it, It looks that good! I have had a PS4 since the beginning of July but have not used it much because I just could not stop playing GTA online on the PS3. Anyway, I was a little skeptical at first to re buy a game I already own and love, I mean up until GTAV came out on ps3 my favorite game of all time was Vice City on ps2. But i am glad I did. If you are on the fence about purchasing go ahead and take the plunge and rebuy, you will not be disapointed.",5,0,Good

"Rockstar has imported the same fantastic game on ""current gen"" to ""next gen"" and now has never been a better time to get this game. Running at 1080p at 30 fps is certainly an upgrade, and graphics are pretty damn good. The world is densely populated and detailed. GTA online is never spotty and holds up to a max of 30 players. Story is diversed with different missions, but usually having to drive to everywhere gets tiresome after some time. With the ps4 version, the dualshock 4 is immensly utilized with the touchpad and speaker, which is great with being a cross platform game. Every review has her own perspective on the new first person, and heres mine: First person is a touch that makes the game harder as there is a smaller range of view. It's different and a bold step by rockstar. I like it.GTA 5 is the same great game created a year ago, but is ""greater"".",5,0,Good
"Like many people, I first played this game when it was released on the previous generation of consoles. Back then it was one of Rockstars best games and the same can be said today (C'mon Rockstar, give us Red Dead Redemption remake!). I was a little apprehensive in re-purchasing the game since I put a lot of hours into the original but I have no regrets. The improved graphics and better frame rate make the world feel even more alive. Simple things like switching between characters is much faster. Also, the added first person POV can easily be toggled by clicking the touchpad on the PS4 remote. I wouldn't recommend playing that entire game in that mode, but it definitely has its appeal. Overall, if you haven't played this title, this is the version to get. And if you have, well, enough time has passed to return to Los Santos.",5,0,Good
"There is so much to like about this game I won't even talk about. I don't have a problem with the violence and lewd nature of the environment and situations but why do so many of the characters have to be dirtbags. I'm a nice guy and would like to play a character that is a nice guy and has a nice guy story to start. Let the player become a dirtbag if they want, not start off that way. Running over people and mowing them down with a machine gun would feel much more significant and impactful if you could identify with the character rather than starting the game automatically branded a dirtbag of whom most people are not or at least not yet in my opinion.",4,0,Good
"This was a well anticipated game! The story line was a great cross from what Rockstar has done in the past, so I loved being able to switch between 3 concurrent (yet still different) stories and characters. Online is a great improvement, also. In fact, I find myself Online more than in story mode. The ability to claim and set bounties, fulfill independent or team missions, or ranking up makes the online experience something that we've never seen before on GTA. Online was not without some bugs and late deliverables, but here's to hoping 2015 is a year of excitement! This is definitely a game worth buying. The revisit to Los Santos (previously from GTA San Andreas of Xbox) was worth the wait. The graphics of this gen's format and first person playing really add to the overall GTA experience.",4,0,Good
"Really loved this game! I didn't think GTA 4 was all that great, but GTA V makes up for it. I liked that you have three characters to play at once, and you can switch between them to try different missions. And for some missions, you play all three characters at once, and can switch between them to provide cover fire for each character or to do something specific.Overall, the game is a series of heists that you plan out, set up, then execute. The ""heist"" gameplay made it fun, always felt like you were progressing the story (unlike GTA 4, which felt like you were just churning through large parts of the story until something else came along).The big value of the game is the online games. I'm not a big online gamer, so I didn't play too much of that.",5,0,Good
"The PC version is plagued with KINDA, SORTA, ALMOST real 1st person controls. Rockstar did technically implement them, but they feel very generic like the controls, or ""feel"" from a $5 budget title game. The game itself had a fun story, not short, good characters all around. There is a torture scene that the game does not allow you to bypass. There is only meaningless, empty online ""addons"" from Rockstar now. No singe player stuff, so if you buy it now for console or PC you might as well play it as is. The online content are just textures for clothes, cars, and some new models for vehicles (materialistic).4/5 because even as good as it is, no love for SP addons, and the modding is limited on the console versions!",4,2,Good
"Played the PS3 version to death, even played the story mode a few times on it, it's obvious the PS4 version is better graphically and makes for a better gaming experience. But I wouldn't necessarily say it's a must-have if you already have it for the PS3 but only money to spend on just 1 game. 1st person, while a good idea, is just ok in actual practice. I actually still prefer 3rd person most of the time. Driving a car in 1st person is pretty tough and requires more restraint than in 3rd person. Shooting in 1st person becomes way too easy, if it already wasn't before in 3rd person, but watching hand to hand combat is pretty cool. Overall, this is a fantastic looking game on the PS4 that you must get if you don't have it for previous gens, but may want to think about if you already have it.",5,1,Good

Tonnes of content, great story, memorable characters and I am only talking about single player.If you decide to jump in online that's a whole another beast that can be hit and miss. Online introduces grind, microtransactions and sometimes less than nice people. The great thing is that if you don't want any of that you can keep playing solo. This game is definitely worth it just for the singleplayer experience alone.",5,0,Good

I had such difficulty getting the hang of playing again but it is coming back to me.  I love the storyline and always having something in the game to do.  My stepdad even liked it, which I was surprised because these used to not be his kind of games.  Honesty, this is the only game I play on the PS4.  I don't get to play often but when I do I take full advantage of it and have a good time!",5,13,Good
"I really liked this game when it came out for ps3/xbox360, and the same is true for the update for the now current Gen consoles (I have it for the ps4).I really like the new first person view, as it adds more immersion to the game. It can make you a bit dizzy though when you fall down or get git by a car :P.The increased density of traffic is also pretty cool. It feels more like a live city than the last gen did.They also increased the online cap pet server to 30 (from I think 12-15 last Gen? Don't quote me on that) which adds a lot more for races and random riots.Overall I really enjoy it, but these are just my thoughts and with a game such as GTA, it can be seen very differently for different types of people.",5,5,Good
"It's definitely a good game for a new players. The game has good visual, especially for people who are interested in cars and there are day and night times. which makes it feel more realistic. You also get to play different characters with different personalities. The story is mostly about doing dirty work with people from the hood and getting away from the cops.I think the game did a lot better than GTA4, but there just isn't much to it, where every mission I'm either killing people or stealing from a jewelry store. It's better to switch between others games and come back after a few days, so the game doesn't few old.",4,1,Good
"So GTA 5 is about the most fun game there is, if you're willing to wait a while, or pay up front, for what makes the game fun.Your best strategy for this game is to join a crew that has a peaceful lobby that will allow you to complete your missions worry free of grievers. Otherwise be prepared for non stop harassment by those who own all the cool toys. And don't you even think about blowing them up since it'll cost you dearly.It'll take you a while before this game pays off, fair warning. It's designed that way intentionally. Unless you're willing to invest right out of the gate, this game will be painful to get going.But if you don't mind investing say 39.99, they got a decent starter pack that should make the game more than tolerable.This game falls short of almost eveything it was supposed to be. The things it mocks in this very game, it became just that. A company obsessed with milking its customers, and spamming them with things they don't need.Graphics: 10/10Options: 10/10Storyline: 7/10Microtransaction obsessed: 10/10 (watch reviews on youtube before buying anything)Memorable game: 10/10",3,1,Normal

Honestly this is a game if you not cannot play it as such then you do not need to have it I believe this to be an adult gay if you're an adult and you let your child play this and they act out situations they find in game or if they get an attitude because you can't let them play the game or or violent do not let them have this game. Rockstar does a good job of updates but there are still plenty of exploit they refuse to fix and allow the cheaters to run amok with aimbotting glitching modifications and all-round general environment that makes a good time negative for a honest player,5,0,Good

Grand Theft Auto V for the ps4 has surpass the expectations i had and has brought me back to the GTA world. In my opinion GTA V is the best off all in the franchise and its very well crafted with alot more to offer. This game is ultimately fun and will drive you right into the action world, with that said and the fact that GTA 4's online play sucked, GTA V's online gameplay is a whole new world and refreshingly awesome!",4,2,Good

I have to say it was a great purchase!  If you can deal with the R-rated language and situations, you'll find it's a very fun and engaging open-world game.  The amount of things you can do is mind-blowing.  There are so many little side-quests and encounters, I don't know how anyone could ever do them all!  The world is detailed and feels like a real city.  I'm looking forward to many more hours of entertainment for this game!",5,2,Good
"So great. I owned it for Xbox 360, and felt silly buying it again for a next gen system, but am really I glad I did. Graphics are stunning, GTA Online is vast and awesome. New online content is being added often, always plenty of people online to do online specific missions with. I'm starting to get the hang of how to make GTA $ and am enjoying establishing my online avatar in the world. The new stunt races are super fun. Just get used to other players being jerks in general and trying to wreck you in races.  Its just unavoidably part of it. It is satisfying though when they try and wreck themselves instead. :)",5,0,Good
"I am not a ""gamer"".  I am just a dad who needed something other then Skylanders or Lego games to play.The game is just challenging enough.  You can play for hours and not progress in the game.  There is a 100 hours of things to do that doesn't have to do with missions.  i.e.  fly a helicopter over the island, go for a dirt bike ride, climb a construction crane take a few shots then do the honorable thing.The only thing I don't like is there is a ton of foul language though the whole game.  I knew it before I bough the game so I wasn't surprised, but it is hard when you have kids.  It really limits the times I can play it.",5,0,Good

There is SO much detail in this game I'm still finding funny things after a year.The graphics upgrades look much better when compared to PS3 side by side. But honestly I did not notice anything more special when playing the PS4 version. One of the best features that they added was the first-person camera. It's difficult to play with it, if you're trying to be competitive, but it really makes you appreciate the detail that went into this game.",5,0,Good
I lovw this game but for whatever reason the full text isnt dispayed on the screen. It makes it difficult to follow the speech and action prompts. The story mode is interesting but sometimes it gets in the way of the classic rampage gameplay.

"I reviewed this for PS3 and I gave it five stars. I would give this version more if I could. Everything great from the old game is still there, but now it looks better, runs more smoothly (although still at 30fps), and even has some added stuff. At first i was skeptical at the idea of buying the same game again, but now I think everyone should do it. It looks a lot better, and has an amazing first person mode. I played the whole campaign through just in first person. It also has new cars, over 100 new songs, and some extras for returning players. Even if you buy this again, you won't regret it!",5,4,Good

The game definitely looks better than it did on the PS3, and it's nice to have bigger lobbies online.However, the PS4 version suffers from the same network issues the last-gen editions did. I spend more time loading than I do playing with my friends. When I actually manage to connect to the same lobby as any of my friends, it's not immediately easy to navigate to where they are. Furthermore, joining jobs together seems impossible. I find myself having to host jobs and invite my friends. A way to join jobs as a group would be much appreciated.",5,0,Good
To the kid who said that you have to buy gta online separately. That's a lie! Anyone with a ps4 and some common sense would know that any online actions on ps4 u need playstation plus DUMMY! Anyways the game is a massive upgrade from the ps3 and xbox 360 and transferring characters wouldn't be easier all you need is your rockstar social club email and password and you can play your old online account on the new enhanced gta v for next gen consoles. You can only do this one time so if you have both consoles and gta v u might wanna choose wisely on which console is going to have the online account. First person view is stunning and I totally recommend for retuning players or new future players.,5,3,Good

"GTAV is an amazing game, especially on PS4. I have to take a star off for two reasons: 1) input lag. I had to mess with the controller settings for 30 minutes to even get the game to a playable level, and it's still not perfect. Controls are just too muddy and laggy. 2) the mission system drives me crazy. It's hard to tell exactly what you're supposed to do next after you complete a mission. The map is confusing and unclear. Maybe I'm missing something but I think it could have been better. Nevertheless, the game is great.",4,0,Good
It is definitely a good game and addicting to play because you get to kill people drive on people kill other players and do heists and go to the barber and go to the clothes store and go to the strip club and go to the beach and tell other players some shot.,5,0,Good
"I debated with myself if I were to take off 1 star due to weird UX issues of setting up online play... But then the gameplay, graphics, and just pure fun overrode my decisions. There are so many things you can do in this game! Want to jack a tractor? Yes, it can be done. Want to race through the skies in a parachute race? They got that too! Just tired and want to goof off with a few sets of tennis? The game has that too. The latest release of 'Heists' are some pretty great co-op missions that can keep you busy too. And don't forget about the music or satire, because it really does set the mood and puts together an awesome game environment.",5,2,Good

"10/10 stars. Even though it is a remake from the PS3/Xbox 360 version, they went above and beyond the call of duty for having a one year later release time. The graphics boost looks incredible after upgrading to the next-gen system. Graphics alone would be a great reason to buy the game. The biggest thing however, which everyone is raving about is the first-person mode. This personally sent me over the edge to the point where I'm going to stop typing this review and say that to any fan of GTA, this mode is a must try. It will alter your view on GTA in hopefully the best way possible. Rockstar did a very very stellar job with integrating the first person into this game. Graphics, fun, guns, woo.",5,0,Good

"Although online gaming isn't exactly what I wanted it to be... the game is still great. I find myself coming back to this game all the time when I am bored with the other games I am playing. As always the game received critical reviews in regards to the vulgarity and violence, but if you don't like it, don't play it, don't want your kids playing it, be more involved in their lives. Don't ruin it for the rest of us, let us enjoy our mindless animated violence. If you have played any of the other GTA games you will love this one, sticks to the good old stuff while introducing very unique characters with a high replay value for online as well as single player.",5,2,Good

"There is no problem with the game itself.  However, Amazon's delivery is too late.  Other courier companies are responding quickly.  It takes 3 hours from that, even though I am coming to a nearby delivery station.   I know I'm busy, but I'm a member and I want you to deliver it a little earlier.  The game itself is a star 5.  I have purchased it twice (laughs)  Even if it is PS5, it is said that it will be out, but I wanted you to put out 6 ...  PS4 online will continue for a while, so you may be able to play a little more.  I think PS5 will evolve as well.  For a while, I can play with PS4! !   I think that beginners can buy it now.   Overseas, VC hunting and PK population are also fascinating, so there are a lot of enjoying, so you can play with confidence, I feel at least less than the Japanese version.   When I was a beginner, I was hunted in the Japanese version ...  So, I think it would be convenient to have both software! ! <BR>  It may be good to divide the rank in the North American version to the robbery, etc. from the Japanese version.  I did this. <BR> * If it is a North American version, people will gather people. <BR> To put it together, there is no regulation → there are many enjoyments → I feel like there are many weirdos (laughs)",4,2,Good
"I've already played GTA V for PS3, so I'm not too concerned about the game itself. The case for the game just bothered me a little. The game disk and manuals were intact, but the clips which hold the manual in broke off completely. In all honesty, it does not seem to be a mistake made by the transport according to the looks of the break. However, I am still pretty satisfied with the punctuality of the delivery. Like I said, I'm not too happy about it, but I'll be just fine.",4,0,Good
I was never big on the grand theft auto series but after playing this I dont know why I was ever so hesitant to play it. This game is hilarious and had me laughing on end through the mission. Not only was it enjoyable but it also had some challenging gameplay and it was very well thought out. It is also gorgeous and I had just as much fun playing the side missions as I had the main story. Its easy to see why this was full price for so long. It was worth every penny.,5,1,Good
Best game,5,0,Good
"It's the same GTAV you played and loved on PS3, with some extras! A couple new vehicles, some new guns, and a few other random things for good measure make for a surprisingly fresh experience. The first person mode can be loads of fun (try off-roading, you can't see where you're going at all!) and completely disorienting at times (fly out a car windshield in FPV once, it's great) plus you now have the ability to save and share all your stupid video clips and pictures! It's pretty great, sell your old copy for $25 on EBay and pick this one up (if you already have a PS4) and you won't regret it. If you do, don't blame me, I didn't say anything.",5,0,Good
"That said, it takes almost an hour to install. DO NOT LIKE.Also, the text is too small. I have a 60"" television but I don't sit right in front of it, I have 20/20 vision with my glasses but the text is too small to read quickly. Please make an option to enlarge the text by at least 50%, there are a lot of complaints out there about the text size. It looks like it was optimized for someone sitting in front of a computer screen, not a TV 8 to 12 feet away.",4,15,Good
Five stars for imagination and reality as ugly as that might be definitely a technological marvel but if you can imagine it on the streets it really is going on in this game parents beware if you can do it on the street you can do it in here,5,0,Good
"Having played GTA V on the PS3 I was expecting the same thing but with a few upgrades. However the picture quality is smoother, sight distance is a lot more in depth, water looks sharper, sounds are more crisp, and you can fly passenger jumbo jets in single player mode. What is not to love. Online is still just as good as on the PS3. It was hard to stay in a lobby on launch, but if all it is doing is disconnecting me I can deal with that. Better than loosing character data like last years launch. So far I am having a blast, can't wait to level up in online and complete the single player again. Worth every penny.",5,1,Good
Nothing about the game is bad it’s the best game I’ve played in years I purchased this game 6 years ago when it came out and it’s still astonishing. The weird thing that happened is that instead of the normal version of gta it gave me the premium version which is good I guess?,5,1,Good
:thumbs_up:,5,0,Good
"More of the same, campaign characters were uninteresting and the inclusion of three different campaigns definitely show how the care and work was divided among the three. If they did just one character the single player would definitely be a lot better. Don't get me wrong its a great game but as a previously avid player of GTA 4, this felt like more of the same and got boring rather quickly. If you have a dedicated group of friends to play it with though then its definitely worth getting, especially now that it actually has some amazing multiplayer options available.",4,1,Good
"This is a great game. The lighting and character models have been improved to a point where it is one of the best looking games of this year. It also now supports 30 person online lobbies which include races, deathmatches, and the heists coming in a 1.4GB Day one update. I recommend this game for everyone if you have played the last gen version or not, this game is a great experience with a pretty much endless replay value.UPDATE: Sorry, heists are not coming out today, 1.18 update was to make gta online works for the new consoles pretty much. What I heard is they will be released a week or two from now. Still a phenomenal game.",5,3,Good

"Good game it was worth buying again not the whole 60+ dollars but for 39 it's an easy buy, but the graphics are great the PS3 and Xbox 360 version were already polished but the new gen versions are outstanding I was definitely impressed. But if you had it on the previous gen systems it's worth buying it again at the price that it's at now which is 39 dollars and the first person view is the main upgrade and it makes the game look totally different it's almost scary lol but it's still fun to play the game again in the upgraded version.",5,0,Good
"This game has a good story, but If you haven't played this, the controllers, are not the best, and if you don't have an SSD, loadings screen are going to take so much time.",5,1,Good
"Much better then Xbox 360 version. I had the 360 version and I couldn't stand the load times. I quit playing the 360 version shortly after picking it up. It took forever to do anything, even the simplest things like entering stores or changing clothes took a long time to load. The graphics and load times are much improved on this PS4 version. The only delay I experienced when the game had to install for the first time. This game is a blast and a must buy!",5,1,Good
"The game play is nearly identical to GTA 4. The controls are clunky at times but not terrible, it's most noticeable in the new first person mode. I nearly ran over a cat but instead I wrecked my car trying to avoid it. I chased a small furry critter into the woods while exploring but I was attacked by a cougar and died. I jumped a car Dukes of Hazard style off a mountain and survived. I tried again and died in a fiery crash. If that sounds fun you may like this game. Also strippers.",4,10,Good

"Never was much of a GTA fan, but I do have to say this was rather fun to play. It came in great condition as well!",4,0,Good
"Great game, personally have gotten more than my money's worth from it. Story mode keeps you interested and gets you used to the game while Online play is a great way to hang out with friends or meet new people. Be wary when playing online for people trying to advance their kill count or just generally troll. Developers often take way longer than advertised for promised content but content included should be more than enough. Overall great game recommended for gamers 18+ as the rating suggests, plethora of adult content.",4,0,Good
"So much to do.  The story is very long, but there's a bunch of other missions to do once that's over.  The graphics impressed me on PS4 and looked so realistic when flying a plane/helicopter.  The water looked real and the lighting is great.  The main characters are great and this is definitely the best GTA game that's ever come out in my opinion.  The online doesn't work very well and takes forever to load, plus you must have a Playstation Plus subscription to even play online.",5,1,Good

"Some of the missions get a little boring, but a really fun game.  If you are offended by anything, I MEAN ANYTHING, stay away from this game.  Lots of drugs, killing, strip bar time, and swearing here to make you go to confessional after 5 minutes of game play.  The intro and opening scene include a bank robbery with lots of shooting, cop killing, and swearing.  My wife even wonders if I should be allowed to play it and I am in my 40's.",4,1,Good

"This game is very vast and realistic. The cut scenes look like something out of a movie. The controls are very intuitive. You can do things like get a haircut, buy clothes, and buy guns. The city of Los Santos feels like an actual vibrating city. With all this being said, this game is obviously for adults. There is a lot of profanity and sexual innuendo throughout the game. Once you think you're done with the game, there is a number of things to do, especially the online heists which have been recently added to the game. This is a must buy for any type of gamer.",5,2,Good
Nice game and more fun on online with ps plus .,5,3,Good
"I bought this digitally on ps3 on Day 1...its my favorite franchise, so long story short...its the same game but with first-person view and better graphics...the transfer from ps3 to ps4 online was flawless. When i beat the story i will leave a review but the online i give an A...it has its hiccups in terms of staying on or finding good room...but i mean theirs like 40 millions people that have this game i dont expect it be perfect...but nothing happens that makes me not enjoy the game. I would highly recommend and wish you all check it out if your into open world games.",5,0,Good
"People!  Stop letting your 10-year-olds play GTA.  Super fun game, but very adult-themed.  Also avoid the online, its nothing like the single-player game unless you are looking for something different from the single-player game.",5,0,Good
"This game is just as fun as the rest within the series, GTA online is a lot of fun with friends, you guys can set up a private server and play together or you can go straight into the really thing and play with many others, some people are trolls however and will kill you in game multiple times which will frustrate you when you're just starting out because they have more than you, my recommendations is to pay with friends until your character has enough equipment to play by yourself or with friends in the open servers.",5,1,Good
"So what do you do in this game? You steal cars and drive them; you go to night clubs and you watch the characters say sexual and racial stuff and do drugs all the time and you occasionally shoot some people and that's it. The game is rated 18 because of these things but in reality it,s mainly directed to teens who can't do these things in real life yet and want to do them in a video game, because I sincerely doubt that many adults will find it interesting when a video game character goes to strippers club or take drugs.The challenge in this game is 0 besides learning how to get used to the horrible controls of planes, not because your characters are super powered but because the whole games is designed to be suitable for kids and teens who like to enjoy their fantasies without being disturbed by challenge or any sort of obstacles. You have thousands of dollars since the beggining of the game so you have basically unlimited numbers of ammunition, but you wouldn't need any guns beside in certain missions because there are no enemies in the world of this game, just you and unlimited number of civilians to ""mess with"".Buy this game only if you find stealing and driving cars is a fun thing to do, if you want a good challenge with a mature setting then go and look for something else, this game has nothing to offer besides ""cliché-ing"" evreything related to US teens fantasies about gangs and drugs.",1,4,Bad

I played this on PS3 and can't what to see the new updates Rockstar made on GTA 5 for PS4. I heard there whole lots more stuff you can do in single player and online play which I love the most. This is one of the most game I play about every night before I go to bed for work. And times hard to get off. Can not wait to get my new PS4 console in the mail and play this one. If you have never try GTA 5 you should. Try today and see all that online play can bring you and.,5,2,Good
"The game is excellent, many hours to invest in history mode, a huge map and a lot of variety as general and optional missions. The multiplayer is good, it is simply not to my liking since mostly runs below 30 fps (understandable for a game with a map of this size and the detail of the graphics) in addition to that it is quite uncomfortable to use the system of Auto-Aim If you previously played any shooter.  in terms of the package, I came in an envelope just as most game albums, I am not sure if I crushed or hit but the map came somewhat broken , the game was intact and the box also but it is as if at any time sufficient pressure had been applied to the disc box to break the map paper.",4,4,Good
The product came early. It was a great shape and I had no problems with nothing.,5,0,Good
"Great product. It can take some time to get used to the controls but once you do, you will have several hours of fun guaranteed. Last GTA played was San Andreas (big fan), this one has a lot of new stuff like playing with different characters and pre-missions before a big job. The only thing that got me bored was the missions where you have to learn how to fly because they are pretty much like the ones in San Andres. Apart from that the game is great for adults.",5,1,Good
"bought and got the game quick and new so no problems there but the game itself isnt the best, i was actually pretty disappointed in it but my kid loves it so i guess thats a plus.",4,0,Good
We recently bought a PS4. It was originally for my girlfriend since she likes playing the God of War games. I wanted to give it a try since I haven't played on a Playstation since the PS2. I had played GTA V on the Xbox One before and it definitely handles better on the PS4. I still prefer my Xbox One generally but certain games just don't seem as suited for it.,5,2,Good
"This is always a great game to play, especially if you are looking to just kill time.I love playing it with co-workers and friends online! I never do the story mode I strictly enjoy the interaction with others.I wish I obtained the 1.5Mil promo code that my friend got by purchasing it 4 days earlier than I did for online virtual currency in game. That would be cool to still obtain but if not no big deal!",4,1,Good
"I could not be happier, because the request was imported from the USA so it expected it to take at least two weeks to arrive according to the period to start shipping provided by Amazon, however UPS did an excellent job in the delivery, because I received the Package in just a week, that is, in the middle of the time that had originally been scheduled. OK. You have several additions such as the first person camera, graphic improvements, less load time, better textures, more detail, better frame rate, etc. Anyway, if you liked GTA V for your last console and you are doubting whether merits the purchase again, go ahead, you will not regret it.   If you have not had it, do not hesitate, it is an excellent game with a gameplay Imsecable, you will take hours and hours of fun.",5,2,Good

"This is a 10/10 game by everybody. Everybody except me. I kind of knew what I was getting into, but hey, after a week of playing, there is SO MUCH wasted time in here. I am not impressed at all by the graphics either, and the story is not compelling. I played Mafia III a month ago, and it is way better than this. The story and characters are compelling, not here!What bothers me the most is that I am not clear on what I have to be doing here, I am not sure how to move from one mission to the other. I may keep it, probably sell it, but I am not giving this more than 3 stars.",3,2,Normal
Ok,4,0,Good
This game rocks and the online version rocks as well.  It seems that rockstar has corrected past complaints and minor bugs in there gta series. They are always updating the online version as well. I really cant say anything negative or bad about this game. Every aspect of it is awesome. The online version use to chug a little when you drove fast but they have sinced fixed that issue. I played the xbox one version of this game and the online aspect of it was not so good. The xbox one version seemed to skip and stutter alot at times.,5,2,Good
The single player story mode is good. It's very long and you can spend a lot of time cruising around and doing missions. Very addicting and could play for hours. I'd give it 5 stars. The reason I'm giving it 3 is the online part. It's very fun but it's absolutely ridiculous to have to be playing 5 year old kids. I wish somehow Rockstar could monitor the age of people playing it. It's absolutely an adult game and is fun when you get in a lobby with all respectful adults. The 5 year olds make it unbareable. Sure there are its downsides but overall online offers a lot more gameplay. Just get the kids out of it.,3,1,Normal

"Now I really enjoyed the Grand Theft Auto V story and kind of enjoyed the multiplayer but if you already own it on previous generations there's really no need to buy it on next gen. True the grpahical upgrades, and first person modes are cool but I found myself in laggy online mode and eventually got bored of the new effects in about a week. Bottom line if you already bought it don't buy it again, and if you don't own it go next gen.",4,1,Good
Great game. Just know if you want to play PS4 online you have to Pay to Play. This game is a  great game but it is just as good on PS3  I own that one too  and didn't have to pay 49.99 to be able to play the game online. After a year I will have to pay again unless another console is coming out lol  And also PS4 is only compatible with HDMI tvs so if you own an old tv the analog that can't use HDMI be prepared to buy another tv too. Yep. Great game.,5,0,Good
"GTA V on the PS4 will give you endless hours of entertainment. When compared to the PS3 version, the graphical updates are very obvious. The shadow and lighting effects along with dynamic terrain make it feel like a new world.Unfortunately, the frame rate suffers.. It would've been nice to experience GTA in 60 fps on the PS4. I don't think I can justify buying this game for a third time to experience that on the PC. Some aliasing is present, but not nearly as bad as the PS3 version.Sure, the game has its flaws.. but I think it deserves 5 stars.",5,1,Good
"I'm rating this as 5 stars. The dude that lives on the couch enjoys playing this game. I have not played it.I can only assume that this is a good game since the dude that lives on the couch devotes almost as much time to this game as he does sleeping.I do enjoy watching him smash up cars and stuff, for a lot less than it would be to enter a derby or something.",5,0,Good
Just got the game today and it's still great. Got to transfer my character from Xbox 360 and everything was here. My only problem is that the $10 GTA V Bull Shark Card code isn't working. I get an error saying the code may not be correct or may no longer be valid.  I tried many times and it is correct and I didn't try the code until I was in online. Game is perfect which is why I gave it 5 stars and not any less for the card problems. Don't know what to do about this problem though.,5,0,Good
"This is literally my favorite video game by Rockstar other than GTA: San Andreas so of course I had to purchase it once it was released on next gen consoles (and once my bank account allowed me to, haha).

"I owned a copy of Grand Theft Auto V for  my PlayStation 3, which I sold to help pay for my PlayStation 4. It was one of the greatest games of all time, and they somehow managed to make it even more enjoyable. The updated graphics are immediately noticeable, 30 player death matches are absurdly entertaining, and first person mode is a somewhat clunky but overall welcome addition that immerses you into the sprawling open world recreation of Los Angeles. The characters are unlikable in the coolest way possible, with witty and hilarious dialogue performed by an extremely talented cast of voice actors.",5,1,Good
"Great game. Single player is amazingly in-depth. Also one of the first few games I have gotten involved with that made me want to find out whom the voice actors are. Even better still they are almost the characters them selves while adds to the depth. Then there is multi-player. Huge sandbox world, up to now 30 players tons of weapons and cards and planed and choppers in with to reign death and destruction upon the unsuspecting citizens of Los Santos. This like it's predecessors will be a classic. As usual it's Rockstar...keep it away from the wee ones.",5,0,Good
Had to return game. The game was in great condition and had no scratches but would not work when my son tried to play it. We tried multiple times with no success. Very great customer service though.

"Great open world game, and nice place to come into the series if you're not familiar. Thought the story line and changing  perspectives between the 3 main characters was well done. Fun to play. But NOT for everyone. If you buy any grand theft auto title you should know that they're about drugs, violence, sex, etc BEFORE you buy. This game is pretty much why they have the mature audiences only rating for games. So be forewarned.",5,23,Good
this game has been out for awhile now. if you're looking into grand theft auto 5 then you probably know what you're getting into and you already know whether or not you want to buy it. this game was recommended by several friends. i waited for it to be cheaper before i ordered it.,5,0,Good
"The overhaul for the new consoles is above and beyond.The sheer amount of content in the game alone is staggering. Online is a lot of fun, but the campaign... Is as close to a masterpiece that the genre has seen thus far. In my opinion, the most appropriate and satisfying finale to any game in the franchise.Now accommodating players that really only enjoy games in the first person, as well. I was skeptical, but it plays great from all perspectives. Doesn't feel shoehorned in at all. Great game. Highly recommended, if you've been on the fence.",5,1,Good
"I had been wanting to buy this game for some time but I was waiting for it to lower it to buy it, since in the PlayStation online store it does not fall from 50 dollars when it is in promotion, so take advantage of the Amazon discount. A small detail, as I bought two things, sent it to me in a box instead of envelope, but even so, in the back of the game box a cut is seen, both the box of the box and the game sheet , nothing happened to the album which came subject, but those little details matter a lot.

GTA 5 followed the success of GTA San Andreas, except the size of the map of Los Santos isn't as big as GTA San Andreas.",5,0,Good
"A classic. We'll leave it at that. Okay I'll say more. The 3 way storyline, the missions, the design, graphics, the city, online play, everything makes for a true first rate title. This game will be talked about for awhile. It's as fun, if not more fun than Vice City was. Where GTA V wins is with the characters.

This means that every ""free"" update that has required a GTA$ purchase (in case you're an IDIOT--ALL OF THEM) has required an actual money investment to attain access to. CEO, Bikers, ect. have all required, according to Rockstar, a real world investment to gain access to.Want to be in a posse like in Red Dead Redemption? Fork over real cash to purchase an in game biker club or play the game for an equivalent amount of time in order to use your earned GTA$ to buy it...If the updates were truly free, you would have instant access to all content and features as it became available.I'm a bit Draaaank; but, my option remains the same. GTA Online is NOT free because Rockstar has officially assigned a REAL WORLD value to GTA$.ALL DLC IS PAID DLC.In short, Rockstar is no longer trustworthy. DO NOT PREORDER RED DEAD REDEMTION 2.Warning issued. Any money wasted is the fault of the reader--Not me.",2,0,Bad
"Great Game! But I wish there were more tutorials. YouTube is full of tutorials -- but most are geared for the hard-core player. I am a novice and the lack of ""how to"" is sometimes frustrating. It would be nice if GTA or Sony had access to tutorials.",4,0,Good
"This is a great game. I've played most of the other GTA games and this one is really amazing as far as the graphics and game-play. Everything looks incredibly realistic, there are plenty of missions to do or you can just wander around on your own. Some features integrate with the controller too, like it flashes red and blue when the cops are after you and you hear the police speaking through it. There is also an app you can download that integrates with it as well. Really enjoyable!",5,0,Good
On the inside was the downloadable content but it was expired from last year. Needing a code so I can actually use it. I can send a picture also.,4,1,Good
i spend a lot of time on this  game  and have a lot of fun on it  for  people with kids  this game is rated M  so little kids  should be playing this game some adults should either  LOLover all it is a good  game  in the hands of the right people  it's good  game,5,1,Good
Aghhhhh I forgot the loading times are long. And it takes up a lot of space. Its a fun game but it also seems like each gta game is trying to top how crude and vulgar it can go. Its great if you have friends to play online with!,4,0,Good
"First off, the game looks amazing on the PS4, the graphics, the details, the characters look fantastic. But hopefully I'm not the only one with this problem, I keep getting the error code ce-34878-0 everytime when I play on story mode. I tried every method of fixing and nothing worked. Yet I can't give this game a lower rating hopefully this problem will never happen with a rock star release.",4,0,Good
Even better than expected from the seller I bought from I’m so happy rn,5,0,Good
"The game is every bit of amazing as it was last year. I'm very pleased with Rockstar did with this version of the game on PS4. The visuals are stunning, the framerate is a little bit better, and the attention to detail was giving every little thing. I'm glad that Rockstar knows what they are doing when it comes to making a better port. It was worth owning again and if you never played it before then you will be pleased with this version of the game. Its worth every bit of $60",5,0,Good
"Other than Amazon losing my shipment,then when they found it, it was damaged. no worries they replaced it. the game is by far the best GTA game to date. definitely recommend for any longtime fans or anyone who loves Open World Games with good stories. peace",5,0,Good
Been looking to get it for a while on ps4 and originally had it for xbox 360 (still do) and the price hasnt gone down for over a month (or more). I suggest getting it now and not waiting for a price drop because its probably not going to happen anytime soon. No need to write any facts about the game because everyone knows its awesome! (Btw you can transfer from ps3 to XB1/ 360 to ps4) -if you werent sure like i was in the beginning.,5,2,Good
"I know there's a lot of love out there for this game, but I lost interest after about 10 hours in and I'm surprised I made it that far. Sure, it's expansive, taking ten minutes driving full speed to get for one end of the map to the other. It also has lots of ""mini games"" that serve to distract you from the uninteresting story plot. The graphics are amazing considering the vastness of this open world. So much to like but... But my biggest gripe with this game, and I recognize it's a personal one, is the incessant, tiresome and unnecessary use of foul language. It's like a plague on my earholes. Obviously, this is RockStar Games we're talking about and they're not exactly known for being reserved. But have a little control, please. And it's not like I'm some holier-than-thow prude, I curse all the time. It's just really tough to pour hours into this game knowing that the verbal assault isn't going away and there's no dial or censoring for me to turn it off.I really wanted to enjoy this game. Too bad, looking forward to Red Dead Redemption 2.",2,5,Bad
"I'm not much of a gamer .. the last game I ever owned was San Andreas on ps2 ... decided to get a PS4 so I purchased this game on amazon because it was the cheapest place I found.. all I can say is be careful , this game is really good and super addicting . So many games within a game .. shipping was quick, no complaints",5,1,Good
Grand Theft Auto is one of those games that will never get old. And the price I got it for was just a no brainer for me to buy. $14.99 plus Amazon provided a $15 credit for linking my twitch to my Amazon prime account. Just perfect,5,0,Good
Yeo in time I bought it for a gift to my son I still do not not be but I hope this good at now everything that ecomplicated in this very good grasias roast pajina,5,0,Good
"Had it for ps3 day 1, now I got it for ps4. What sucks is Leslie Benzies left Rockstar to form his own studio and took the  programmers with him... GTA 6 is in trouble, and thats why we never got a single player DLC. Leslie IS GTA. Anyway, the game is awesome and worth it just for the Online itself",5,1,Good
Husband and stepson love it. Came in just 2 days. Graphics are awesome.  Cant get get the guys to put the game down!,5,0,Good
I love the game so much,5,0,Good
"GTA V is great, I love the sandbox.  The storyline is good too.  I wish they would incorporate some of the previous games features like tagging and gang zones.  I'm sorry it took me so long to start playing.",5,1,Good

Son loves this game.,5,0,Good
"My package came on time, it was well packed and shipped. Zero damage to the game!As for the game it's a fun, action packed game that you'll never get tired of. Honestly there is so much to do you'll never get bored! I also have it for the 360 as well.",5,0,Good
after the 4 day of having this game it will not load it will say loading storymode 90% for ever,4,0,Good
Awesome game. My son loves it.,5,0,Good
Great Game. Definitely worth buying for any PS4 owner (that is old enough obviously due to strong violence etc)  This game was better than I expected it to be and even my wife was drawn into it's plot.  I did not do a lot of side missions or play online but just playing right through the story was very fun.,5,0,Good
Excellent product,5,0,Good
"Good game. Huge improvement in environment details, but for human characters, no improvement from PS3 ver.Also, some missions/ hobbies are really ""killing"" time, and I don't know why I should ""waste"" my time to do those sxxt.I thought maybe I'm not fit this kind of game very well. So GTA V will be my last GTA, but, BUT, I don't deny this is a GOOD game.",4,0,Good
"Bought for my 16 yr old. Definitely don’t recommend for a kid at all. Cussing, references to raping someone, strip clubs, gangs etc. I won’t allow my 16 yr old to play it around my 13 and 11 year old.",5,0,Good
"Would give five stars if I only had to review the single player, but the multiplayer has to tack off a star or two.Simply put, it's too laggy, too buggy, often freezes during load outs. These are issues that shouldn't be happening anymore on PS4 or a game as massive as GTA V. Perhaps putting 30 players in one online game session is just too much.",4,0,Good
"Excellent Amazon service, the package came practically a week earlier than expected. One of the best games in recent times, any GTA is always synonymous with quality and much entertainment. gameplay due to the comfort of PS4 control.",5,0,Good
Works great,5,0,Good
I loved this game because it made made son so happy. He is going thru some hard times and it was nice to see a smile on his face.,5,0,Good
I gave a copy of this to my best friend. He called me up 2 weeks later and told me that he hated me because he'd been playing for 2 weeks straight.I say that is some quality gaming!,5,0,Good
"This game is super fun, obviously same concept as the old GTAs but different story line and with the ability to switch between different characters. Now that the price has dipped significantly there is literally no reason not to play.",5,1,Good
"One of the most impressive games Ive ever played. So much detail put into this game! However, there was a ton of input lag that made it unplayable. Thankfully I was able to remedy this by turning the deadzone all the way down and aiming acceleration all the way up in the settings!",4,4,Good
"Great game with good upgrades in graphics and content from the PS3 version. Not sure it was worth buying it full price again though. I probably should have waited until the price came down or there should have been a deal for existing owners from Rockstar/TakeTwo, but who am I kidding it's GTA.",4,0,Good
It is constantly being updated and content is regularly added which is rare in a game that's been out for awhile. The story of the single-player campaign has more character development than a good movie but the online play is bland and repetitive.,4,1,Good
"Loved the story mode, you can switch between 3 different characters with all different styles and attitudes.  Great open world to explore.  Great variety of missions.The online mode is absolutely ridiculous.  Trying to get a private session with just your friends is complicated and rarely works even though you follow what appears to be the correct steps, -play gta online-invite only- seems correct but once you enter that world you start a mission and suddenly you are thrown into a session with a group of ignorant children using inappropriate language and racial slurs, and when you quit the event to try to get another ""private session"" you are labeled by Rockstar games as a ""bad sport"". I'm a bad sport??????? Because I don't want to hear a bunch of kids yelling and acting inappropriately?????????  Also another down side to online mode you are constantly being called on your phone by GTA A.I. about all these different missions its extremely annoying!  The design of the online GTA is just so overloaded with garbage that you can't just invite friends pick missions and play, there are so many requirements that it is no fun to play.",1,8,Bad
I like this game because you can play heist and get night vision goggles and the gear rebreather and the new clothes doing missions and get 100000000 million dollars you have to buy it to get everything including new updates new apartments and new cars get everything and you get shark cards and it 80000 dollers in a shark card,5,1,Good
Bought this for my son and he was very pleased great value for the price,5,0,Good
This game is amazing. When i got it i still got the map which is surprising because this is a old game that came brand-new. I remember other games i got brand new didn't come w the manual and etc. The wrapping here was official. This game is also so fun. I get lost in this game in for hours!,5,1,Good
Could spend hours playing,5,0,Good
"not sure if i got lucky, but i received the premium edition!",5,0,Good
"Not worth the money if you already had the PS3 or Xbox 360 version.  It's the same exact game and everything that was bad about the previous version on PS3 is in this game.  The play control is still horrible at times.  Nothing has been improved except the graphics.  The graphics are great, but they weren't that bad before.  You can transfer a previous online player but you will have to start the single player over.  The game came with a money code for 1million dollars.  500k online and 500k in single player for the character active when you redeem the code.",3,4,Normal
Really good quality. got what i wanted,5,0,Good
good quality product I definitely don't have complaints I recommend it a lot,4,0,Good
"Great game, only gripe is that I am unable to transfer my character from my PC to my PS4. Have more friends/family playing on console than PC. On top of that, you are only able to transfer your multiplayer character once. Stupid concept but it doesn't really break the game itself.",4,0,Good
"The game came in a big box and in the best possible condition. The game by itself is amazing, and I got it for about 25-30$ cheaper than I would on the PlayStation Store. I would definitely recommend this game to everyone, it’s a really good deal for this type of game.",5,0,Good
I bought this game because it's a really good game. But when I received it the game case was broken. Looks like my Amazon package was stepped on or something. Otherwise a great game for a great price,5,0,Good
Still one of the best games on PS4 even if the way the use shark cards on on the ONLINE mode is a bit predatory. Main story is worth a play through and the game is just solid.,5,0,Good
"Because it is Europe and the United States, there is only English, but real is good! !",4,0,Good
"I bought this for my older teenaged son for his Bday. He already had it on the PS3, but had heard the graphics were better for the PS4.. and i guess there was added content or some type of improvement for the ps4. He says he likes it MUCH better on PS4 and is glad he asked for it.",4,0,Good
You already know what it is if you're thinking about buying it. And if you're an adult who has no idea and thinking about getting it for your kid DON'T! There is WAY too many adult themes and content in here not to mention online is nothing but a steady stream of profanity and death. Great fun if you're of the age and love the series. NOT A CHRISTMAS GIFT for your 6-12 year old unless you want them using some new colorful language at dinner.,5,18,Good
"I love playing with my sister online, but seriously people shut up and leave people alone once in awhile.",4,0,Good
"I mean, what else can I say? There's a reason GTA V is the best-selling game in history lol.After I finished story mode for the first time, I immediately started a new one and played it all over again because it's that fun. Get it, it won't disappoint.",5,1,Good
Very good,5,0,Good
This game was an amazing game and i had it for the 360 but i recently got a PS4 and i really wanted it for PS4. Manly because they had stopped the DLC for online on the 360 and i loved online. This a great game and it came on time and in perfect condition and i defiantly recommend getting it.,5,0,Good
This game so far is amazing. There's so much to do. The added first person mode is really fun. Fancy cars are really easy to come by in this one which makes it more fun. I hadn't played GTA in quite some time and this game brought me right back. Rockstar knows how to make an open world game.,5,0,Good
"Yeah, my son likes the game. so I got it for him, again. Even though I got it for him for the PS3 or wanted it for the PS4.Have had no issues with the game.",5,0,Good
My daughter really enjoys this game on and offline. Good graphics and if you're a GTA fan you need to add this to your collection.,4,0,Good
Great,5,0,Good
"This game is work. Go here, drive there, pick something up, drop something off. I feel like a Hollywood grocery runner. That being said, it's pretty rad to wreck mayhem in LA. The PS4 graphics are amazing, the story is Meh I'd like a new local. I've done GTA in LA a few times, right?",4,2,Good
"This is such a good ps4 game! The story mode is extensive with different outcomes according to all the little things you do. Online play is great as well, plenty of mission and activities to play with people from all around, just try not to cross paths with that adolescent kid who's just shooting everyone for no reason. It's really fun to play with friends though, well worth the money.",5,0,Good
"Not a huge difference between PS3 and PS4 version except for more cars, the 1st person view and slightly better graphics. Good to buy on sale don't buy at regular price. I still enjoy playing it though.",4,2,Good
Didnt realize was disc only. But game works great!,4,0,Good
"A great game - huge play area, decent missions, lot's to do.  Graphics are great in general but aren't as mind-blowing as expected (but by no means terrible).  Driving physics are fairly arcadey but good fun - as per all GTA games, it should probably be kept away from the younger kids but that's nothing new.",4,0,Good
Best of the franchise thus far!,4,0,Good
Awesome :thumbs_up:,5,0,Good
"Gift for Christmas. I gave it 4 stars because I do not know first hand how good the game is, but I have heard no complaints about it.",4,0,Good
"I've bought this game about 7 times and I'm never disappointed. The reason I have bought the game so many times is when I think there are no more updates, and I trade it in another update rolls out. Def will be keeping this time until GTA VI comes out.",5,1,Good
had for the PS3 re bought for the PS4...still love it! Few features are different and something is up with the stock.Not near as predictable as the PS3 version but that could be from Updates!Still awesome story line! LOVE IT!....and yes I played all the way from the GTA PS1 version to now! Faithful to the.... it better never end!,5,0,Good
"I thought i was gonna get the regular game, like i wanted but it gave me the premium edition and im good with that lol",5,0,Good
"Impressive GTA game! Graphics are amazing, gameplay is fun and has a lot of stuff to do. The city is alive and amazing. Driving in the variety of vehicles is incredible. EVERYTHING is a good experience. Even if you don't like Sandbox Open World games, you'll definitively like this game since it has a well done story, cheesy enough to be taken lightly but well done to be a movie. Recommended! Also, Trevor is an INCREDIBLE character.",5,0,Good
Included a map of the city. A surprise!,5,0,Good
"What's not to dislike? GtaV is always a boredom fixer. If your not killing pedestrians or blowing up air planes, you're doing it wrong! Graphics are phenomenal and first person mode is dope!",5,0,Good
The characters are creative. Options at the end of a failed mission are improved. The process of making money to buy businesses is ridiculous. No point in using cheat codes for health armor weapons etc.,4,1,Good
"I have played this game before and got to the end of all the missions on PS3. I was hesitant to get it again for PS4. The missions are sightly more complex and that makes it fun. Also, the graphics are so much better than with the ps3 game. I did not think this game could get any more clear, but it can! :)",5,0,Good
Purchased for kids and they loved it.,5,0,Good
"Did i never review this on my list?? oh wow. (Grrr) anyway, No complaints (other than it takes a nice LONG while to download, so give it a good couple of hours. But maybe thats just my system) But other than that, Its GTA lol. Love it.",5,1,Good
Came on time ..Installed with no issues ..No lag in the game..Only thing is the casing came broken but the CD was still in tact and wasn't affected so it wasn't a big deal.,4,1,Good
Great game! Have barely gone through story mode because of all the side quests/extra content.,4,0,Good

"Way better vision effect than PS3 version. Have Chinese subtitle.Bad news you need to know is you mush spent several hours to install it in your PS4,many G data needs to download, update pack and don't know what files. Download and install,than good thing will come, what a wonderful game it is! Everything fine and beautiful in this version,although I have no complain for PS3 version, but this one is much better.",5,0,Good
Wonderful.  Nice packaging. Just love it,5,4,Good
"I didn't play online, only the campaign mode.  It was a lot of fun, but I preferred the old school ones where you only had one character.  It made the plot more deep",4,0,Good
Excellent,5,0,Good
My absolute favorite game of all time. However modders and glitchers make it impossible to have fun sometimes.,4,0,Good
"I got lost in this game when I started it up. The ability to change characters throughout gameplay keeps everything nice and fresh. See myself wasting many weekends on this game in the future.  Same GTA feel, but improved shooting &amp; storylines. The phone feature in the game and the ability to hear audio at certain times through the PS4 app was startling, but great features.",5,0,Good
I had when it first came out 2013 if I remember and it was for ps3 but now I got a ps4 and it brings back so much memories,5,0,Good
immersive gameplayamazing explorationoverall its just a great game.,5,0,Good
"Loved it on the old gen system (PS3), so whats not to love on the new gen one (PS4)?-Plenty of visual improvements over the old version-More wildlife-GTAO safe mode improved to help curb aggravation (like when you want to simply sell a car to make $ and people destroy your vehicle)-Easy import of online character to the new system (though I wish you could make progress on all linked systems)",5,0,Good
"There is no honor among thieves. This rings true with the online mode. Don't bother making friends because they will eat you alive. On the other hand, law enforcement will have fun with the Gang Attack challenge. You can take revenge on gang members with little or no pity.",5,0,Good
It hard to play but you will get the hang of it I recommend this product,5,0,Good
I was given the premium version but I just wanted the standard version,3,0,Normal
"I love this game, it brings all of the old aspects of GTA that we love, but with better character and story development. As well as top notch graphics and realism. For God sakes, when it rains it becomes harder to drive if you don't have good tires! Haha.",5,1,Good
I had to re order this game after mine went missing (nothing to do with amazon or mail) and I'm glad I did. I had the urge to play it and haven't put it down since I received it.  GTA series has always been great and this is no different,5,0,Good
"I'm not huge on the idea of buying a game that I've already played, but in this case it's worth it. Take the aspects from last Gen and imagine the amount of work that came into Next Gen. Everything is greatly improved. The visuals look amazing, the first person is pretty fun and just having the Power of Next Gen has harnessed the greatness of this game. So what are you waiting for?! Go play with your friends",5,1,Good

"GREAT game all around. Compelling story with characters you really come to care about. Soundtrack is diverse and rocks. Gameplay is solid and has the usual nose-thumb at society. The world is huge and open and the graphics are simply stunning.

"If the language settings on the PS4 side are not the language corresponding to the game, the language in the game is set separately, but once the setting is made, it cannot be changed again unless the PS4 account is changed. But a little dissatisfied. If you want to change the language in the game depending on your mood, such as French, Italian, or English, do not only use the PS4 itself except for the language that can be set in North American GTA5 software such as English and Portuguese. You can do it, but don't play the game as it is.   There is no particular complaint.",4,2,Good

"Im not an extreme gta fan but i have enjoyed the games over the years.having bought this game on ps3 and growing tired of it,i didnt bother buying this on ps4 . Graphics just werent enough. Bit after my friend showed me the game, and on top of that the 1st player action,wow...blown away...had to get it .....its a complete new experience ...short and complete thought",5,1,Good
"Excellent game and excellent product, I have for more than a 1 year and the truth that has been a good purchase, highly recommended",5,0,Good
"Worth it, I had it on PS3 but I wasn’t gona buy it for $50 or $40 on PS4 smh got it for $20 and it came in unopened brand new",5,0,Good
One of the best GTA games out of the series to come by. It's freaking hilarious. The script is superb. The music not so grand of a selection. You cant have this game without Trevor. Wonderfully entertaining and lots to do.,5,1,Good
"Well needless to say, my husband's productivity has taken a nose-dive.  Him and a buddy sit and cackle like teenagers when they play this.  It's a little much for me but his playing time is a good excuse for me to go sit somewhere quiet and read a book.  The graphics are amazing and it almost  feels like you are watching a movie full of very, very bad human beings.",5,0,Good

So I bought this thinking that I would be getting English - US version but what I think I got is Spanish - US version as you can see it in pictures. It does have English but it would have been nice if they have mentioned it. Plus you will get premium edition not the standard one as shown in the picture. So I will give 2 stars for misleading description of product.,2,0,Bad
"Bought as a Christmas present for the hubbs. Graphics is amazing. Audio, such as dispatch over police radio comes through on the PS4 controller as well as other in-game experience (vibrations, shaking etc.) Very cool. Transaction was straightforward, no hiccups, and got it well before Christmas. I can't comment much about gameplay since I don't personally play it, but it must be good; I haven't seen much of him lately. ;) jk",5,0,Good
"Wonderful remaster of the xbox 360/ps3 version of this great game. The PS4 version of Grand Theft Auto V maximizes the potential of the game by adding better damage, a better frame rate, more map detail, first person mode, and other aspects that were limited by the Xbox 360 and PS3 hardware. The first person mode is also incredible, and in my opinion is better than some first person exclusive games.",5,2,Good
I had grand theft auto for ps3 and decided to upgrade to the ps4 version after I got a ps4. The game graphic 1st person mode and game play made it worth the 30 I paid for it.Overall I am dissatisfied with it. I received the game on time but the front of the disc was completly scratched up. I knew I wouldn't get a brand no product but you could atleast let that been known in the description,3,0,Normal

"I never thought I was a gta type of person but this game is fun! I spend a lot of time just wondering/ driving around, enjoying the world Rockstar created.

"I have owned all versions of GTA, and waited to finish this game 1st to give a quick, honest, GTA veteran review.I know about all the positives about open world,  realistic graphics, new 1st person perspective, online play....reason for 3 stars.Player controls are clunky, still curious as to why RockStar insists on the pendulum system for player movement. Many times I have had to replay a mission or were killed because of poor controls......reason for not giving 5 stars.",3,2,Normal
"I bought this game when it first came out and I still jump into GTA online 2016. Maximum replayability. The first player story mode is one of the best-written games Rockstar has created to this day. If you're a gamer, and you haven't played this game; what are you doing with your life?",5,0,Good

"Bought game for a friend so we could play online more. The online is way better than the ps3 version, because ps3 has sucky servers for some reason compared to ps4. First time we played together I went on to an overpass so that we could get into the same car. He shot me off with a .44.10/10 would buy again.",5,0,Good
GTA 5 is still great in 2019. I brought it for my little cousin. He loves the game. I love it as well when playing online.,5,0,Good

"In the Japanese version of GTA, there were too many people who did not do it, so there were no people coming to the job, so I couldn't get started, so if I purchased the North American version, people would start gathering as soon as I set up a job. 。 And there are few PKs, so you can play leisurely.",4,0,Good

"Had this game for 360 and enjoyed it a lot. Great game to play with friends. I was cautious to buy it for the new console, worried it wasn't worth $60. I couldn't have been more wrong. First person playing with 1080p makes this a completely different game. Not to mention it runs much faster, and supports larger lobbies. 10/10 would buy again.",5,0,Good
Love this game. This is the second time buying it but this time for the PS4 instead of the 3. If you buy this game for the online experience which I don't even play much personally then that mode will be a gigantic plus for you.,5,0,Good
"The game just look super amazing! There is just one thing....I use to play it on ps3 online a lot! and i used to use the phone internet by wi-fi!, it has 2mb.... and well....ps4 looks like need more speed than that! so i recomend a good internet speed..at least 3 mb...and also need to know something i didnt know...on ps4 playing online is not free! :D",5,1,Good

"Happy since they are unforgettable hours of entertainment that I have passed by having it in my collection, it will make you enjoy as you have no idea. I also bought it for Xbox One but I keep this version for PS4 for me it has better graphics and what I liked most is that control brings a speaker and the voices and effects are heard wonderfully. And every time the police challenges you in command flash red and blue lights. The very fast delivery service for well packed DHL. Thank you very much Amazon I will continue buying with you.",5,6,Good
"Awesome game so far! Took a break to play some other games, but I am always thinking of getting back to this one. Its just so long!So many interesting characters and gameplay elements.

If you never had a GTA V on PS3, you should buy a GTAV on PS4. It's mandatory for people who have a PS4.",5,0,Good
"as GTA goes, this game fails next to San Andreas and other Rockstar titles like Red Dead Redemption. The character are weak, their back stories poorly developed and generally I didnt care about anyone. Not enough side missions or rampages or anything that made previous GTA games playable for weeks.the whole game seemed to be centered around online gameplay and for a story player, this was just insulting and superfluous. If you cant unlock everything without buying a gift card with real money for game money what makes this game any better than Candy Crush? little. very little. I am over the GTA series at this point. I think Rockstar has pushed the game as far as it can go and it is dead.",2,4,Bad
"Great game. Still not Vice City, but still a masterpiece. I would recommend this game to any GTA / open world game fan. I haven't really played online, but spent over 60 hours on the single player. I spent most of that just driving around aimlessly. I'm only about 73% done after finishing most the campaign and most of strangers and freaks.",5,0,Good
I have been out of gta  since ps2 had gta2. I love this game! Graphics and language (foul) are awesome. World is huge! My only upset is it looks like you can't change characters (at least not yet) in story mode. I won't be using the online part of it. Do the characters become available in story mode? Either way I would buy this again!,5,1,Good
"The game was package very good..no dents or anything....The disc was still secure and had no scratches at all....idk if they changed it but I was able to transfer all of my stuff from gta v(ps3) onto here....so I got my level,cars,money, and everything else",5,0,Good
Works perfect and came earlier than expected.,5,0,Good
"In the North American version, the same online characters came out.  And since the data was taken over as it was, it is okay not to start from scratch.  I feel that overseas servers have more people.  Also, are you different? The way the game progresses is different from the Japanese.",5,0,Good

"I originally bought the game, and it was defective. However, Amazon replaced it free of charge.The game is great, and Amazon service was great, too.Gta online needs some work, though.

Great game! Got it for my husband as an anniversary gift and he loved it. Game works perfect in his ps4. Great buy.,5,0,Good
The game is great. All of the additions to the ps4 version are awesome. The first person camera is a little to low in the cars which makes it hard to see the road sometimes. Things like windshield wipers can block your vision. Even if you already bought this game for 360 or ps3 it is worth buying again if you like the GTA games.,5,1,Good

"It,s like my dream to get GTA 5",4,0,Good
Grand theft auto 5 is one of the best games. It offers an open world experience as well as a storyline and a multiplayer option for even more fun. The game is very violent and has strong language so its not for younger kids to play.,5,2,Good

WOW! I bought the PS4 at launch and hated that this game was only for PS3 at the time. Finally it has come to the PS4 and I am so happy.

Another great game in the series and if you like the previous games you most likely will like this one too.

Husband loves this game... I don't play but have watched him play and it is very entertaining.  The graphics are pretty amazing and the story lines just hilarious to watch play out.  Very violent with a ton of swearing but that's all part of the GTA scene.,5,1,Good
Perfect,5,0,Good
"Ok if you're thinking about getting this game, don't think anymore and just get it. You won't regret it at all, I promise. This game is just pure awesomeness. The only con is your social live will declined. But it's ok you can just play online and get new friends.",5,0,Good
"Immediately you are put into a role where you are robbing a vault and kick down down a defenseless elderly security guard from behind in the back who is already kneeling and is no threat whatsoever. A defenseless, innocent and helpless woman is immediately and violently thrown to the ground as she cries for help. I chose not to watch any more. This game is in clear violation of the moral law and MUST be made illegal according to the civil law as well. This is a clear reflection of our failing American society that SO MANY people would give this ""game"" such a high rating! First chance I get I'm moving to Poland. May God have mercy on the U.S.A. my most beautiful country that I love!",1,1,Bad

So glad to get it without paying over $40. This is exactly what my brother was looking for so yeah. It's perfect !,5,1,Good

The multiplayer is pretty decent, although Sony should probably give Rockstar a bigger share of the PSN money.Here is my complaint:  Rockstar support is the worst support for any video game ever.  In fact, it is the worst support for any product / service ever.Their servers are not always stable, which Rockstar has admitted, even though the support part of the company did not get this message.  Just hope you don't have an issue with them, because they are miserably the worst.Buy and play at your own risk.",1,2,Bad

"I installed the North American PS4GTA5 ordered on March 4, 2018 (Sun), so I installed it. I thought it would take a long time because it was WiFi, and it took about 90 minutes to update the Japanese version in December last year.  There was no need to create a new account to play the North American GTA5ONLINE, so I was able to play with PSID created in Japan. PS PLUS was also able to play in the Japanese version without the need to purchase a new North American version.  In the Japanese version, there is not much experience in the gathering of the number of jobs, but now it seems that the transform race is twice as a prize and RP, but twice. It was a quick job full or one person was not enough.  It is difficult to play without English proficiency, but if you do the Japanese version, the arrangement of the options will not change, so you will get used to it immediately. However, be careful because the decision and cancellation are the opposite of the Japanese version.",5,17,Good

"In the Japanese version, there are no people in the job, so I purchased the North American version of the common server in the world, but I bought it and it was the correct answer! Jobs that do not match at all in the Japanese version, such as racing and hostility mode, will match in an instant, and people will gather immediately.  The most happy thing is that when you host a robbery, you will have all the four people in less than a minute. In the Japanese version, there were many times that I gave up without waiting forever, but that is not the case. I think that the North American version is better for those who do not PK or vandalism.",5,37,Good

"It is my personal impression to the last, but please refer to it if you like.  First of all, I don't like it, but it's an overseas North American version, so it can't be helped, but the textbooks on text are foreign languages such as English. Then the decision button has been changed from a marbot to the battons. In the PS3 version, both the Japanese and the North American version were the same.  Other than that, there are more things I like.  The total capacity of the game software is 55GB, so it takes time to start the game, but when the game actually starts, it is the beauty of the screen that you can understand. I was glad I purchased the PS4 body.  I wanted to play this software and purchased the PS4 body, but I am very satisfied rather than regret.  I would like you to experience the first -person viewpoint, which is an additional element of the Xbox One version and PS4 version. The world view changes.  The reason I bought the overseas version was because I wanted to play an untreated overseas version because the content was regulated. I think it is still worthwhile when the Japanese version of the PS4 version was released.  So, I recommend this software to Yu PS4 users, saying, ""I want to play Grand Theft Auto 5, which has not been regulated.""",5,14,Good

"This game is stupid.  Too much time is wasted waiting for it to load.  The language is chronically profane unnecessarily, except as humor to those under 18 for whom the game is not to be sold to or played by.  The controls are difficult which makes game playability irritating and un-enjoyable. Bought this game only because it was $39.99, however I believe the actual value of this item should and will be $15 soon.  I have played and enjoyed Valiant Hearts (which is free) more frequently.  Bottom line, this game does not live up to it's old reputation and new hype.",1,4,Bad

"First of all, this game is very interesting.  Graphics are almost five years ago, so if you play from now on, you will not be impressed. It takes a tremendous time to play every corner.  Because it has a high degree of freedom, you can enjoy changing the way you play flexibly   It is not operability, the GTA series emphasizes reality, so it runs and stops. Inertia of time  The operation is light and it is difficult to get used to it.  The screen also shoots a bang from a distance that looks like a bean grain from a distance.  The opponent shoots with a handgun even though the enemy is not visible. <BR> The police are persistent, the potatoes are intercepted, but they are killed until they give up, but the commander is stupid  Online is too expensive to buy anything. There are expensive cars and weapons as well as asking mangli or hacks.  And the performance is broken. For example, a pump action shotgun or  this weapon is aiming for the enemy with Auto Aim, and if you shoot, you can defeat the opponent even if you shoot. Where are you heading?  Even graphics are inferior to the current games, so  I think it's okay to be put out in this work that should be put out in 6.",2,2,Bad
"Although you have already played the PS3 or Xbox 360 version, this remastering is very worth it. It has too many improvements that justify your purchase. Just for the graphics, it is worth it, it looks much better. An indispensable game of this generation.",5,0,Good

There are so many people in the race and there are many invitations, and unlike the Japanese version in the free session, there are very few kids that are PK while ranting in VC, and I can play happily.  As for English. If you know the minimum word, you will have some meaning.  If you speak very fast, the hearing will not catch up, but you are not good at English. There are a lot of friendly players who talk slowly and more than the Japanese version.",5,6,Good

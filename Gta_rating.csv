"Jason White\na year ago\nEven 8 years later, this game is easily one of the best that you can buy.\n\nWhilst GTA Online has gone in a direction I don't like - and wouldn't really recommend in engaging very much with to complete newcomers by this stage - I can't ignore that it still has thousands of hours to offer players across a variety of different activities - there's something for everyone in GTA Online and it will also make them money whilst they're at it.\n\nSingle Player is also undeniably a brilliant experience.

"Aleksandras Kybartas\na year ago\nGrand Theft Auto V is a 2013 action-adventure game developed by Rockstar North and published by Rockstar Games. It is the first main entry in the Grand Theft Auto series since 2008's Grand Theft Auto IV. Set within the fictional state of San Andreas, based on Southern California, the single-player story follows three protagonists—retired bank robber Michael De Santa, street gangster Franklin Clinton, and drug dealer and arms smuggler Trevor Philips—and their efforts to commit heists while under pressure from a corrupt government agency and powerful crime figures. The open world design lets players freely roam San Andreas' open countryside and the fictional city of Los Santos, based on Los Angeles.\n\nThe game is played from either a third-person or first-person perspective, and its world is navigated on foot or by vehicle. Players control the three lead protagonists throughout single-player and switch among them, both during and outside missions. The story is centred on the heist sequences, and many missions involve shooting and driving gameplay. A ""wanted"" system governs the aggression of law enforcement response to players who commit crimes. Grand Theft Auto Online, the game's online multiplayer mode, lets up to 30 players engage in a variety of different cooperative and competitive game modes.\n\nThe game's development began soon after Grand Theft Auto IV's release and was shared between many of Rockstar's studios worldwide. The development team drew influence from many of their previous projects such as Red Dead Redemption and Max Payne 3 and designed the game around three lead protagonists to innovate on the core structure of its predecessors. Much of the development work constituted the open world's creation, and several team members conducted field research around California to capture footage for the design team. The game's soundtrack features an original score composed by a team of producers who collaborated over several years. It was released in September 2013 for PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, in November 2014 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One, and April 2015 for Microsoft Windows. PlayStation 5 and Xbox Series X versions are scheduled to release in late 2021.\n\nExtensively marketed and widely anticipated, the game broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history, earning $800 million in its first day and $1 billion in its first three days. It received widespread critical acclaim, with praise directed at its multiple protagonist design, open world, presentation and gameplay. However, it caused controversies related to its depiction of violence and women. Considered one of seventh and eighth generation console gaming's most significant titles and among the best video games ever made, it won year-end accolades including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. It is the second best-selling video game of all time with over 135 million copies shipped and one of the most financially successful entertainment products of all time, with about $6 billion in worldwide revenue.\n51 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,51,Good

"Kyle Ellis\n6 months ago\nWarning: Spoilers\n\nTrevor is just love!! He has these tough guy looks and energetic and humorous dialog that makes him better than the other two characters. I think I'll spend the first few weeks playing only him before Michael and franklin.I laughed so hard when he was shouting at the cops chasing after him,he isn't much of a hot-headed guy, he's cool most of the time(at least for the time I was free roaming).Most of the gta fans see him as a sociopath but I think Michael deserves to be called that too.A big thumbs up to the voice actors for bringing life into these characters.\n\nI started exploring the massive world GTA V offers and I must say the craftsmanship is simply stunning. It is clear that it was designed and implemented by people who really wanted to produce something that was revolutionary, and without skimping on the details.It seems almost limitless. From AI cars flashing their high beams when you're driving on the wrong side of the road on a collision course with them, to the seamless integration of the radio stations with the world you're in, to . . . well, a dozen pages could be written on the details alone.\n\nThe world is massive! If one word could sum up the game I think it would be 'detail'. Every aspect of the game is as detailed as possible and it is easily the best game ever made respective of the technological possibility in 2013. For instance, the AI of the people walking down the street is almost creepy, it seems like these are living people. The dialog is truly impressive, I believe that this game could compete with some of the best films around.Fantastic acting, worthy of film awards, breathtaking graphics, beyond realistic physics, and just enthralling game-play make this the first truly next-gen game that goes beyond just better graphics, pushing the limits of what I thought was possible.\n\nRockstar is genius for a making this game so immerse, so realistic, but yet manages to keep that funny, satiric GTA feel. Congrats Rockstar, you deserve your success.\n5 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,5,Good
"Lil Daw Finn\n3 years ago\nStory Mode: GTA 5 is an action-based game that takes place in the state of San Andreas but in the city of Los Santos. You play as three main protagonists, the first for a Grand Theft Auto game. One of the characters you play as is Michael Townley who fakes his own death to get out of the life of crime under the witness protection of the FIB under a new name, Michael De Santa. He's now living in Los Santos with his two children and his wife, Amanda. Our second main protagonist is Franklin Clinton. Like Michael, Franklin results to a life of crime such as robbing liquor stores and warehouses, anything for some of the needed money. He too lives in Los Santos where he stays with his auntie, Denise. Franklin commits active crimes and does kill gang members but he isn't stupid and he tries to branch out from the hood life so him and his crush Tanisha can live somewhere away from all of it. Our third and final protagonist is Trevor Phillips. He is the first character in GTA that actually works, his personality being a sociopathic narcissist who will kill for fun, actually matches the setting of randomly blowing things up and running people over. Trevor and Michael were buddies back in the old heist days, they'd do scores together until it all went south and Michael faked his own death, leaving Trevor M.I.A only to return later in the game watching the news and hearing about Michael being potentially alive. This game is amazing, which is an understatement but the open world is gigantic with several different landmarks and terrain as you drive around. The gameplay feels smoother than it ever has before, with even faster cars, even bigger guns, and even more people to shoot at. The storyline might not be the most interesting, but actually being able to plan a heist and pick who you want to hack and drive and provide firearms is mental. Making stupid decisions for a heist can also affect how it goes down, you may lose money, someone might die, it's just crazy how in-depth the game gets. The game can get slow at times but if you wanna take a break from the main story, do some side quests which are referred to as ""Strangers and Freaks"". 100% completion of this game doesn't come easy it will take some grinding and some time consumption in order to acquire the 100% you may need to watch YouTube videos for help. Overall the story mode to this game is top-notch and I give RockStar props for creating such a banger of a game.\n1025 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",0,1025,Bad
"Delta V20\n2 years ago\nGrand Theft Auto V is a best action,adventure and a fps shooter game with 2 fascinating modes Story mode and Online mode, The developers done a very hard working procedure on making a spellboundic game with breathtaking euphoria physics. The overall story mode experience is 10/10 in my opinion with a lot of mind blowing easter eggs,secrets and plenty of more stuff and also the missions have variety of physics and realism. From 2011 the hype of Grand Theft Auto V was from streets to the skies but it's still have a hype in 2020 like the developers Rockstar games and Rockstar north will make single player Dlc unlike R* said on 2015 they won't make any Dlc for story mode except Online mode but now to remain and increase the hype and get milk i guess they will make a single player dlc which will not be free unlike gta online dlc updates,but then on 2013 the Rockstar services wants to make the Grand theft auto world a real living world by adding multiplayer features in game eh but in 2021 gta online will become a standalone game it will detach from gta v. So on gta online gives all players across the world a overheimengly positive living open world game experience of mutliplayer with tons of different cool dlc updates in game of online mode like refreshing the game mode with tons of various new activities so on the gta online mode made the whole game live a more better life and giving a lot profit for the developers like this game has sold a tons of copys from 2013 to 2020 and so on rockstar games made alot of money from a single game also their isn't a movie which scored a lot of money than gta v.Well so i recommend this game to whom who haven't played yet i recommend it to play once and then you are going to live in this breathtaking open world game. The game is going to be expanded and enhanced on story mode after it's release on PS5. so hang on and hope for the best.\n273 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,273,Good
"Dan Hughes\n2 years ago\nCredit where credit is due, this game is fairly enjoyable.  The story mode is entertaining and engrossing, Los Santos and the surrounding area feels vibrant and alive, and there are a seemingly infinite amount of things to see and do.  That being said, once you get over the scope of the game and all the tiny details, you begin noticing all of the flawed/broken mechanics.\n\n  Every car handles similarly, regardless of vehicle type, which is to say they all handle poorly.  Traction control is applied at random, and is absent at launch, but present while cornering.  The most mundane econobox and the most visceral hypercar have relatively the same top speed, which isn't very high.  With that in mind, land vehicles are still the ""best"" mode of transportation, even better than walking.  On foot movement is slow and sloppy.  Precise movement is near impossible.  Your character will ragdoll for the silliest of reasons, from trying to walk up a hill, to literally walking on a flat path.  Helicopters are the worst.  Piloting them ranges from slightly annoying to an all-out nightmare.  Flying forward reduces altitude, stopping quickly throws the vehicle in to a fit.  Engaging enemy aircraft is an exercise in anger management.  \n\nFirearms are clunky and underpowered.  Anything short of a headshot requires an excessive amount of rounds to down an enemy combatant, exacerbated by a poorly implemented auto aim system, which is all but necessary when playing with a controller.  The system struggles with even minimal visual obstruction (foliage, leaves), and loses targets at the worst possible moment.\n\nThe story mode has all but been abandoned, not seeing any significant update in years.  All of R*s attention has been focused on the online portion, which doesn't bode well for their dev team.  Load times are insane, lobbies are always overcrowded, and the servers crash constantly, most notably after finishing an activity.  Speaking of the online experience, prepare for one of the most toxic multiplayer experiences to date.  Trying to accomplish a delivery mission?  Some griefer on an Oppressor is about to ruin your day.  Trying to perform one of the randomly generated community events, like driving the longest distance without crashing?  One of the NPCs just crossed the street and t-boned you, even though there is nowhere for them to go on your side of the road (this behavior has apparently been hard coded into the game, because why wouldn't it be?).  So, aside from server issues, enemy players constantly harassing you, and suicidal NPCs flocking towards your speeding vehicle, the rest of the experience is pleasant, right?  No.  \n\nThe absolute worst aspect of the online mode, and the game as a whole, is the economy.  Everything is grossly inflated compared to the story mode (e.g. $1,000,000+ for a Honda Civic, $15,000 shoes), and getting any meaningful amount of money requires grinding the same heists over and over (most of which require a crew and don't pay well), selling goods via your various companies (which also require help, or payout less if completed solo), the new Solo compatible Cayo Perico heist (which is plagued with it's own laundry list of bugs and design flaws), or of course, shark cards (microtransactions), because if you're going to punish your fanbase for playing your over hyped game, why not hit them where they are the most vulnerable: their wallet?\n87 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",2,87,Bad
"Jeff Meme663\n3 years ago\nOn launch day, I was one of the people that preordered the power armor edition not even 4 hours after it became available. After hearing so many bad reviews and general disgust about the game, I was worried that the Fallout 76 game I decided to take a chance in and play was going to be shelved and done with in one to two months from launch date like other games I have played. Boy was I wrong. At first, it seemed very hard to grasp whether Bethesda would commit and improve the game. However, since being in the beta stages for the game, I have seen the game improved drastically. Sure, it is not all clean and polished but they are putting updates out every two weeks, which says a lot in terms of improving the game. They have included more patches and fixes to previously buggy and game breaking gameplay. I just wanted to get the correct information out there so I will be explaining some of things they have done so you can see the work they put in for the last 5 to 6 months. I have enjoyed steady and more stable server use as the months go on since launch date. They are cracking down on anything that is viewed as cheating (duping weapons and modded versions of the game). They have increased the storage size to twice the amount since release date, I hope they increase it more in future updates. They even had time to add more content to this game, and they are working on getting more patches. Dungeon will be coming out (so excited to fight strong enemies whenever I enter with a group to see how far we can go). They have made a survival mode pvp server worlds that are different and separate from the pve server worlds in case you do not like pvp and just want to explore the world (also they have implemented a new system where if someone attacks you, you will not receive damage or die from the attacker unless you attack them back). I haven't really come across players that are mean or want to make sure you have a bad time in Fallout 76. For example, I met a good player the other day who gave me a ton of serum mutations that cost about 60-70k in total caps (which is hard to get that amount in fallout 76 especially from vendors) for free without wanting anything in return. Apparently, he gives them out for free to anyone that needs help. So I don't believe everyone in Fallout 76 are toxic players, but some of us try to help each other out when we can. I have enjoyed being able to name my stuff, have stronger and  more farsighted turrets than before.  They have changed the mechanics of some monsters (scorchbeast as an example and spamming attacks). They have fixed more quest buggy issues and helped pool vendors caps together so you dont have to run around looking for caps. They made sure to let vendors have multitude of notes so you don't rely on RNG to get the plan you need for a gun or power armor part. They have gotten rid of the spawning issue for robots in whitesprings. They have started putting good stuff in atomic shop like cool looking power armor. They have put a news and announcement board when you enter into the game. They added a new battle royale mode and already started putting out updates to fix the battle royale mode. Also, they are planning to release human npcs, which will be an awesome addition to the game along with vault raids! nice! These are just some of the updates they have been doing since the game launched and they have been true to their word doing two updates every single month. I am eager to see what other updates they have going forward. Also, I have RECEIVED my new canvas bag, which looks nice if I might add. They fulfilled their promise to deliver this bag in the timeframe they gave us so I do not feel like they scammed me or anything. To me, every dollar well spent, and I am in no way regretting my purchase unlike how others have been making it seem with the classic ""people are still playing this game?"" I can assure you others are playing and like me we will be playing it for quite a while.\n332 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",0,332,Bad
"Kanishk Mishra\na year ago\nMy go-to game when I've had enough of the real world and want to escape reality for some time. Expands well upon that one mechanic every other GTA title missed - immersion. Drive around the posh Vinewood streets looking for exotic sports cars or explore the Grand Senora Desert and expect random encounters with muggers or hitchhikers, or take a U-turn and climb Mt. Chiliad, to feel on top of the world. The game comes with endless hours of gameplay even after completing all the missions, and the first-person mode coupled with your own tracks makes even aimless driving feel fun. The only downside is the wanted level system, which activates even when you stealthily kill a random NPC in the middle of the desert in the dead of the night. Nevertheless, the game is efficiently optimized on all its ports, which allows it to run even on low-end machines. The gameplay physics is spectacular, but in no way you must expect it to be near real-life since GTA V's not supposed to be a simulation game. In the end, this game will make you forget all your real-life problems for a while, as you step into the shoes of either Franklin, Michael or Trevor and feel the Los Santos sensation.\n46 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,46,Good
"Ryza 005\n3 years ago\ngood gmae i like anime though so it makes it a bit worse but honestly i think that its a good game despite bad press and bad button pressing and overall i think its a good game but i also think that that one character called Steven is pretty overused when you find him late game, not a spoiler, just a random encounte that people can encounter and yeah so its reallly a good game its just a bit unbalanced in the fact that you can get kachowed by some absolute unit in the first 20 minutes of online play. Don't forget the fact that the submarine has an air limit and makes life dificicult when my controller dies and i have to go to the store to go get a new controller and a new headset (unrelated but it was expensive) if only there were some giveaways am i right? Nah but really its a good game but the balance is oof and too many ships and nothing to spend money on tha t is of direct use other than guns, but after that its the large amount of things to buy that make  it really annoying and unbalanced escpecially the taxations so just like in real life tax evade.\nYeah tax evasion is actually a neat mechanic irl and in the IRS office in game. It looks like a normal building but like the government they are not what they seem so its now a tax building, not as run down as it used to be of course\nI just want some friends\nto play with of course, I have plenty of friends. THe xbox group posts i havnt cheacked out but i do believe that its pretty good. To be completely honest i just hope the teaming up is balanced I love balanced games like assasins creed odyessy. its pretty neat also. yeah so really just a \ngood game and i really really just super much want some friends to play the fun and a bit boring and lame game with me.\ndont worry though i have plenty of friends who also tax evade\nbut y'know how it is nowadays for an 'evader' such as myself.\nanyway, this is \njust youre friendly neighbourhood gamer who likes balance as much as the next guy and has a bunch of gam er mates\n496 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",0,496,Bad

"Puroo Roy\na year ago\nAfter I joined college I started playing PC games, and that was the time I began learning about gaming outside of Nintendo. Open world games were something that really fascinated me, so that was the genre I started from. I played Assassin's Creed and Watch_Dogs, but I didn't understand why normies liked GTA so much. I thought it must be because they don't know about bigger ad cooler games, until I tried GTA V myself. And I have to say, boy was I so wrong! This really is something unique, something I couldn't get in any other open world AAA game I had played to that point.\nGTA V is something I'd call the era defining game of our time. It has everything we want: A good story, interesting characters, a dynamic open world, interactive NPCs and most importantly, it can run on any device (other than Nintendo and mobile phones). I have a habit of playing games linearly, that is, going from point A to point B. I only care about the story of a game and explore the open world only after I complete the main story mode, so that I can delete the game in case my laptop starts going slow (it's an Nvidia 940MX), and also because I have too many unplayed games in my library and I'd choose to finish them rather than look at a game whose story I've already completed.\nAnd that made it even more engaging; because the story is really gripping and funny at the same time. In the beginning I was annoyed when Michael was shown the first time, putting his gun on Franklin's head. But after Michael's family left him I was really interested in knowing how he will fix things back. But then the scene shifted to Trevor. I was really annoyed, and I would always shift to Michael to finish his quests. But after I replayed the game after it became free on Epic, I realised Trevor's story was the funniest of them all. Now Trevor has become my favourite character of the three.\nThe graphics are really realistic. And the best part is, if you have a high end PC you can download mods to make the game look as realistic as possible. There are even mods for bringing your own characters like Superman or Hulk, and the best part is that Rockstar, unlike other AAA companies (read Nintendo) encourages players to do it rather than punish them for the same. The NPCs are also very interactive. They behave just like how any person in real life would. Being an indie game developer myself I know how much effort goes behind doing this.\nJust by looking at GTA V you can see how much love the developers poured into making it. The game has been available for every console from the 7th generation and will also be for the 9th generation. Gaming companies should learn from Rockstar and take this example for their games too (especially Ubisoft, Assassin's Creed II would have been so awesome if it was remastered for PS5 and Xbox Series X). I really hope GTA VI is able to outperform this game. They can take as much time as they want, I have no problem with it.\n12 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,12,Good
"Sannwoy Bandyopadhyay\na year ago\nA very nice game with good graphics. It is actually pretty hard to think that a 2013 video game with stunning 4K graphics ('course when u can play in 4K with ur device) and if u are lucky enough to have an RTX 3090 and an 8K monitor, your mind will be absolutely blown to see a 2013 game have better graphics than a 2021 game or even future games and who knows even PS5 games. So, it also has a user friendly interface and really easy to use if you know the basics of gaming controls both on PC and console. The only pull back is the space consumed but I think that was a pull back till 2015. Now, the way massive space is consumed by modern video games like Cyberpunk 2077. It also has another advantage that it is not very glitchy. Yes, it has glitches of course every game does. What I can tell u is that it is mostly popular for its open world play which adds even more points of interest and more stunning details!! If you tell me I recommend GTA V, Yes! I definitely do!!\n17 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,17,Good
"Jonah Ivor\n3 years ago\nEveryone has heard of GTA V. I no longer play the game, but I thoroughly enjoyed the time in which I did. I'm not going to bother talking about the campaign in detail but I will say this - a perfect video game should feel like a film where you are the main character and this game achieved that at every opportunity. As for the Online mode, In my opinion, as a semi stand-alone game in itself, it is the greatest game ever made for its time. It was so exciting to play a sandbox game with such an in-depth level of graphical detail at the time of the new console release not only on your own, but crucially with your friends. The number of hours some people have put into this game, the staggering revenue it has generated and the fact that it is still one of the most updated and relevant games even in 2019 can only stand as strong evidence to back up my previous claim. (don't bully me I haven't played RDR2 i'm waiting for PC release to experience it). It is the quintessential game to the industry and a testament to what a video game is and should be.\n153 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",0,153,Bad

The story is large and deep, it gives you a connection with the characters. The new way of playing a campaign was awesome. Ever created, this was the best sandbox. This world is so well known by so many players, even after 9 years of existence, almost going into its 10 year anniversary, this game honestly has changed the lives of many. I want to say that if you're debating whether to get this game, get it man.

"Weston Foster\n11 months ago\nSaddam Hussein Abd al-Majid al-Tikriti (/hʊˈseɪn/;[3] Arabic: صدام حسين عبد المجيد التكريتي, romanized: Ṣaddām Ḥusayn ʿAbd al-Majīd al-Tikrītī;[a] 28 April 1937[b] – 30 December 2006) was an Iraqi politician who served as the fifth president of Iraq from 16 July 1979 until 9 April 2003.[8] A leading member of the revolutionary Arab Socialist Ba'ath Party, and later, the Baghdad-based Ba'ath Party and its regional organization, the Iraqi Ba'ath Party—which espoused Ba'athism, a mix of Arab nationalism and Arab socialism—Saddam played a key role in the 1968 coup (later referred to as the 17 July Revolution) that brought the party to power in Iraq.\n\nAs vice president under the ailing General Ahmed Hassan al-Bakr, and at a time when many groups were considered capable of overthrowing the government, Saddam created security forces through which he tightly controlled conflicts between the government and the armed forces. In the early 1970s, Saddam nationalised the Iraq Petroleum Company and independent banks, eventually leaving the banking system insolvent due to inflation and bad loans.[9] Through the 1970s, Saddam consolidated his authority over the apparatus of government as oil money helped Iraq's economy grow rapidly. Positions of power in the country were mostly filled with Sunni Arabs, a minority that made up only a fifth of the population.[10]\n\nSaddam formally took power in 1979, although he had already been the de facto head of Iraq for several years. He suppressed several movements, particularly Shi'a and Kurdish movements which sought to overthrow the government or gain independence, respectively,[11] and maintained power during the Iran–Iraq War and the Gulf War. He ran a repressive authoritarian government[12] notorious for its severe human rights abuses. The total number of Iraqis killed by his government's police in various purges and genocides is conservatively estimated to be 250,000.[13] His invasions of Iran and Kuwait killed hundreds of thousands more.[14]\n\nIn 2003, a coalition led by the United States invaded Iraq to depose Saddam. U.S. President George W. Bush and British Prime Minister Tony Blair erroneously accused Iraq of possessing weapons of mass destruction and having ties to Al-Qaeda. Saddam's Ba'ath party was disbanded and the country's first democratic elections were held. After his capture on 13 December 2003, the trial of Saddam Hussein took place under the Iraqi Interim Government. On 5 November 2006, Saddam was convicted by an Iraqi court of crimes against humanity related to the 1982 killing of 148 Iraqi Shi'a and sentenced to death by hanging. He was executed on 30 December 2006.[15]\n4 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,4,Good
"Jack Cornock\n2 years ago\nI like how the other reviews sound like wikipedia articles. Here's an actual review from an actual person. If you said that GTA V is the best game of all time, I wouldn't argue with you. What Rockstar did for gaming with this absolute masterpiece cannot be understated. We're still playing it religiously 7 years after it came out. 7 years. Let that sink in. The use of 3 protagonists was a great idea and really branched out this game in ways we've never seen before. Getting 3 different perspectives of the same story is extremely interesting. Each of the protagonists hold their own, Trevor is easily one of my favorite protagonists ever, I love the Al Pacino vibe that Michael gives off and Franklin's journey is awesome to see. The gameplay is top notch. I love the gunplay and the driving is stellar, it's much better than the boat steering from GTA 4. The story is incredible, there isn't much of an emotional attachment, but it's still extremely compelling and can easily last for multiple playthroughs. I replay this game once a year because I love it so much. The map is one of the best out there, there's a reason it's used when judging the maps of new games. Online is a completely different story, it's toxic and is pay to win. It's fun with friends, but random lobbies are awful. Overall, GTA V is a 10/10. there's really nothing that can bring down the score.\n46 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,46,Good

"Rory Hughes\n2 years ago\nWhat a game!\n\nI remember so much when this game came out c. 2013, this game was all the craze. It wasn't until 2 years later I finally got it for myself, however. When I first got the game, I had high expectations after Rockstar had just released some incredible games in the last 10 years (Red Dead, Bully, Max Payne, GTA IV, etc.) I will not be covering online in this review, just story mode. \nLike I said, I had high hopes for Rockstar in this game, and boy did they not disappoint! Unlike past games, you have the option to choose between 3 different protagonists throughout the story mode, each of which having their own sets of missions. Many features returned to the game from GTA IV, such as strangers and freaks, but were HEAVILY revamped. Let's take a look at Cletus, a random strangers and freaks mission assigned to Trevor Phillips, the 3rd introduced protagonist. You get to go around the town hunting just like real life. Once you complete this mission, you can go hunting with Cletus another time in Paleto bay, and after that you can go whenever you please. \nI also love the fact that the side characters play such a huge role in the game, like Lester or Amanda for example.. Without these characters the game wouldn't be the same. If GTA VI isn't as good as this, I'm going to be so mad!\n25 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,25,Good
"Tom Ruess\na year ago\nFantastic game. Driving is super easy to pick up but hard to master (exactly what I want in a driving game). The game world is full of exquisite visual details/ the cars also look great. Storytelling/ character are also top notch; having the three separate characters from completely different worlds gives the player three unique perspectives. Shooting is fun too with great variety of weapons and customization to choose from. The music curation is also amazing, offering the best from several genres. There’s not much to dislike about this massive/ gorgeous game. \n\nOnly complaint: some missions are better than others. Some missions can get very irritating very quickly (example: the one where you have to operate like 5 separate cranes in the shipping yard just about drove me nuts lol). Also, flying planes/ helicopters kind of suck in this game imo. \n\nBUT both of the problems I’ve mentioned are minuscule when compared with the overwhelming awesomeness of this game. Buy it if you haven’t already! Offers a more immersive video game experience than just about any other game in the market (I love returning to my home in the Hollywood Hills that is paid for with dirty money hahaha).\n2 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,2,Good

"Tom Fearon\n2 years ago\nGTA Online has been around for about 5 years now and that is just on PC. Unfortunately, Rockstar has their priorities in a very anti-consumer way.  They don’t do anything about modders allowing the same players to go for months on end ruining the sessions of all the other players.  I have had to stay out of free-roam lobbies with more than about 4 or 5 people as anything larger and there is guaranteed to be at least 1 modder that will ruin my experience by randomly exploding me, teleporting me, kicking me out of my vehicle (even in aircraft), griefing in God mode, freezing me so I can’t move, and even crashing my game back to desktop.  Using the in-game report function doesn’t do anything as players need many reports to be flagged, and many of the mods have report protection so it boots you from the session when you report.  This is unacceptable that Rockstar don’t do anything, and in all my years of video games since the dawn of the internet this game has the worst amount of cheating I have ever experienced.  It has caused me to lose millions in money over the years.  \n         What is even worse is that they ban or reset accounts for players who use money glitches just a few times even though Rockstar’s poor coding allow these glitches to happen.  In the past they have also just money wiped players who abuse glitches or done nothing at all, not even given warnings to the players with only the worst offenders who glitch over a billion dollars getting reset.  So when they reset the account of players who have been playing for years and logged 100s of hours who only got 30 or 40 million in a money glitch this is a very abusive practice.  Their inability to enforce, and unwantedness to do anything about modders encourages players to abuse glitches so it is just very unethical of them to take such harsh measures to players who money glitch, especially when they have such a spotty and inconsistent enforcement record.  A rollback of accounts a few days to before the glitches were discovered would be a much more appropriate measure, but Rockstar choses to treat their playerbase in a very disrespectful manner instead.\n The game itself also has many connection related issues such as infinite loading, and disconnections that causes players to lose a lot of money due to failed heists, missions, and business sales.  Many of the missions have been fun, but a lot of the missions, particularly the business ones are unimaginative reskins of one another where you just play delivery boy driving a product from one side of the map to the other in a preset slow vehicle.\n The support services is also among the worst I have come across in video games.  They outsource it to a different company that just has people who do nothing but copy paste scripted lines linking to the faq so when you have a question that can’t be answered by the faq then you never get any assistance.\n It is a pity Rockstar have gone down the route of treating their consumers like trash, but it sadly is representative of much of the video game market these days.\n111 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",1,111,Bad
"jaydeekayex\n3 years ago\nGrand Theft Auto V has an average Metacritic score of 97% across all platforms it's been released on, and is currently the third best selling game of all time, right behind Tetris and Minecraft. For both the average player and the long time Rockstar fan who has seen the series evolve into what it is now, it's not difficult to see why: You play as three different characters--who all have their own unique backgrounds, goals, and motivations--in a surprisingly large and detailed satirical (and arguably accurate) replica of Los Angeles and the surrounding California area (dubbed Los Santos and San Andreas respectively), where our three protagonists end up working together to pull off various heists while simultaneously trying to get out of the mess they've been pulled into.\n\nBut what if I told you, seven years after it's release, across two generations of consoles, the story and character development wasn't the key to this game's success?\n\nThat end is owed to it's online counterpart. Which is, in many cases, for better or for worse.\n\nSince Grand Theft Auto Online (GTAO)'s release, the game has received several updates, ranging from customizable races that would make any person who grew up with Hot Wheels scream in joy, more replicas and mashups of existing cars available for purchase than the average player knows what to do with, to a casino and purchasable high-end apartments that allows you to plan heists with your friends. That being said, if you're new to this game, you're going to be extremely overwhelmed for what is major update upon major update, and phone calls upon phone calls telling you to buy a facility or a bunker. That, combined with the abyssmal loading times (which has been dubbed by the player base as ""Cloud Simulator 2013""), is something that will ward off many players.\n\nAnd that's not even covering the massive amount of tryhards and the wide array of weaponized vehicles they will use to stop you from making money in the game. And in order to make money in this game, you're going to have to grind repetitive missions and tasks in order to do it. A lot.\n\nIf you don't enjoy games that rely heavily on grinding in order to advance, along with the problems and how easy it is for another player to ruin it all, this may not be the game for you. \n\nAnd if you think Rockstar Games will go out of their way to make it easier: They won't. All because it pushes Shark Card sales (What GTAO uses as monetization) so they can further make money in an investment they made seven years ago.\n\nSo, to conclude this review, I'm leaving an open letter to any higher-up Rockstar employee who reads this: You're already one of the biggest game dev giants, you have nine studios that you've ended up buying out and putting under your portfolio, and five of your titles are well within the top fifty bestselling games of all time excluding this one.\n\nWhy do you feel the need to further monetize your games with an online counterpart that has some form of a paid premium? Why in the world is it never enough?\n\nWith Dan Houser out of the picture from here on out starting next month, you need to be INCREDIBLY careful with your future titles. I fear the worst for Grand Theft Auto VI.\n\ntl;dr version: story is alright and there's plenty to do, but if you're going to try out GTAO take it with a grain of salt\n31 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",4,31,Good

"Thomas Hyde Jr\n2 years ago\nSo ive been thinking about how the MC community has become a major crew thing, with hardcor roleplay that is being organized via discord and other social media outlets. But what if they did a revamp in the MC and criminal mastermind updates, where they added a menue for mc presidents to manage clubs as far as members in other sessions, not just in the current session ur in. Like manage crews but given titles, this could also be expanded to mobs,street gangs ect.\n However there is another issue that id like to bring up is there is alot of senseless killing in the MC community because there is no pros or cons to build working relationships with rivals. Now a potential solution is the bunker update. Insted of selling off guns and equipment to random  npc's this equipment can be sold to other MC's or gangs. Now obviously the buyer should be given something for their hard earned money. Rather then it just disappearing. So i propose like a buffed buffed weaponry type of thing, possibly a good way to introduce that rail gun we've all been loathing for. Of cours rival MC's have an opportunity to crash the sale if they have the skills to smash and grab and exit the selling area. But different clubs can specialize in different products. Same as diffrent family's can. And anything can be sold and distributed. This will make the MC and crew life way more in depth and kind of give a reason to not just kill anyone for fun. Because of the relationships. Now id also  suggests that they make a club fund to pay for these so no one member is paying for those supplies and money can be earned by doing club work and other activities and club members will be given salary based on position in the club.\n13 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",4,13,Good

"Md Taha\n2 years ago\nGTA Online is also a noteworthy game to play and it has plenty of pros and cons in its own right. The ability to acquire properties, businesses, compete and/or cooperate with players makes this game an immersive experience and it makes you feel like you mature with your character. You will see your character grow from being a petty criminal doing small time jobs for Lamar and Gerald to becoming a successful mastermind criminal. While this model is rewarding, it is difficult and tedious to move up the ranks. This is especially true for those who are full time students and full time employees because they are time constrained. If you are time constrained, barely starting GTA Online, and still want to have fun in GTA Online I do suggest you purchase the Criminal Mastermind Starter Pack with is roughly $10. I added additional tips to save you the time from watching clickbait 10+ minute youtube videos.\n\nThe Criminal Starter Pack will give you $1 million, a CEO office, an apartment, MC Clubhouse, vehicles, weapons, and clothes. These properties might not be the best locations, but they are a good way to start earning money and once you save up enough money you can get better locations. With the money you earn I do suggest you avoid splurging it on vehicles. The only vehicles worth buying right away is the Kuruma and the Oppressor. The Kuruma will protect you when you do missions and the Oppressor allows you to travel quickly across the map. For aircraft, invest in a Buzzard and a Cargobob. The Buzzard is a great helicopter to use in missions due to its agility and its weapons allow easy kills. Being a CEO also allows you to spawn a CEO in most situations. The Cargobob is a must have if you intend to import and export vehicles.\n7 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,7,Good
"Squishy Boi\n2 years ago\nGrand Theft Auto has always held a place in my heart. Back when i first picked up a copy of GTA 3 I was blown away, and every game after that i loved dearly. But when i finally got around to playing Grand Theft Auto 5 I couldn't help but be disappointed. Don't get me wrong the game is still good (at least the story mode is) The soundtrack is great as most Grand Theft Auto games have great soundtracks. And the visuals looked fantastic, it felt like a believable city. The story was alright, my only real complaints with it is that it was really short, and mostly driving to point a to b and then back to a. That and Grand Theft Auto 5 is missing quite a bit of what Grand Theft Auto 4 had, with physics being dumbed down and the car handling broken. (cars in gta 5 all feel the same, all luxury cars with supercar like acceleration even on thing like a family sedan) But that's not that bad compared to the online aspect.\nThe Online mode to this game that Rockstar always promotes is not great. At all. With load times being around 10-ish minutes, and frequent disconnects the game can be borderline unplayable sometimes. The online is 𝐩𝐚𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐢𝐧 and is not fun to play at all, as a new player you are constantly thrown around by modders who Rockstar does not punish or even make an attempt to fix. This and the fact that Grand Theft Auto online is not a GTA game, with flying motorcycles that can shoot 4 rockets per second, tracer bullets, explosive bullets, invincible cars, flying cars, homing missiles, and so much worse the game plays like an eight year old's dream. Not a Grand Theft Auto title. If i'm going to be honest here I would downright say that Grand Theft Auto Online is more of a Saint's Row clone than anything else. \nIf you were looking for a Grand Theft Auto Online experience that fits with what the series has been for 20+ years, I would reccomend modding this game and getting the 5m mod, Or you could get San Andreas Multiplayer (better in my opinion) what is essentially GTA with 300 other players. \nIt's disappointing such a series has fallen so far I think I may never play the next Grand Theft Auto game (if it ever comes out) because if this is what Grand Theft Auto is now,\n7 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",2,7,Bad

So, it also has a user friendly interface and really easy to use if you know the basics of gaming controls on Console. \nIf you tell me I recommend GTA V, Yes!

"Sam Parker\na year ago\nGTA5 story mode-okay this game was great but it came out in 2009 and they have 0 effort to try and revamp anything like I mean anything. Their online version gets updated bi weekly I can’t understand why they can’t add more features to their story mode. \n\nGTA Online- let’s make one thing clear, rockstar will force chokehold you with microtransactions and their shark cards. Their content is sooooo frustrating. I gave in and bought a enterprise pack and it’s like pulling tar off a window annoying for 70% of the special cargo, vehicle cargo or counterfeit cash factory. You literally are forced to buddy up with someone who has bought the good tier items or you get destroyed by players or their npcs. I will also say, they do have sales on stuff but all of it is twice the value of story mode. The only nice thing about online is the ability to play with other people who are respectful. That is probably like 10% of their online population. Otherwise it’s just aggressive people with an objective to mess with people. \n\nRockstar games- okay these people been around for a while and I’ve played a good few of their franchise: red dead redemption, RDR2, gta4, gta5 and mafia 3. Their games have always have increasing graphics and story lines it’s a great open world game with tons of customization but I felt the biggest fault in their latest RDR2 game. This happens in all of rockstars games… And I don’t want to spoil it but their forceful ending and absolute requirement for Arthur dying is a lousy excuse to not make alternative endings. Like I can choose to have Trevor killed in gta5 but I can’t choose whether or not I have tuberculosis. It’s not just that like if you don’t use the right item exactly when they want it then i guess you’re going to have to restart the mission. This was very bad in gta4… Another problem with rockstar is they have released GTA5 on 3 different console, perfectly fine if they added 4K and updated story mode but it’s the same game using the consoles new graphics engine to support better picture. New disk same game.\nWas this review helpful to you?\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",2,0,Bad

In story mode you can experience one of the best story games I've played.

"Zach Naude\n6 months ago\nUsed to be my favourite game back in the 360/PS3 days, and now its just a saints row clone. Stupid flying cars and bikes that fire missiles... Matched only in stupidity by the endless grind that is GTA online. Rockstar said ""lets do away with any interesting missions and add butt loads of expensive stuff that can only be acquired by stomaching the mindless grind... OR, with our extortionately priced shark cards if you actually have a life and aren't willing to spend 8 hours a day in our lazily created and overmilked open world!"", essentially twisting the arm of the consumer into buying their in-game currency. I mean, GTA Online's MOST EXPENSIVE car on release was about $1 Million... Now the most expensive ones are upwards of 10. An $8 Million shark card is the same price as a AAA game, but it can't buy you one piece of ""top-tier"" in game content? Pathetic. I think GTA will one day be referenced when the laws tighten up around these sorts of things... They've always tread upon dangerous territory. Basically, I've wiped my hands of this game, and it shall not be missed, not for one effing minute. No doubt GTA VI will approach their online platform in the exact same way, and I'm afraid that's exactly why I won't be buying it. You need to pay a AAA premium in order to gain access to more pay walls, making it a worthless buy for the casual player/non-hacker. You'll literally pay AAA prices to drive a Prius around while somebody drops a Nuke on your digital delusions of grandeur.  2 Stars for the game I used to enjoy, 3 stars removed for ruining it.\nWas this review helpful to you?\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",2,0,Bad

"Mo Mehio\n2 years ago\nCame for the single player experience, left because of what happened with online.\n\nTo elaborate, the single player experience of this game was so engaging and new considering you play as 3 different protagonists through a thoughtfully written story even with opportunities to make small but seemingly meaningful decisions here and there. I am actually disappointed the single player DLC was cancelled as I was highly looking forward to at least one more step in the gang's adventures. The map, vehicles and POI's are on a new level; it is crazy to think that a game world made in 2013 has more detail than any other game made before or after has up to this point in 2020. Graphics are decent especially for its time but the game is starting to show age and is begging for a new iteration considering this game is 7 years old now. In addition the game on PC is very feasible to run; for example if running in 720P you can simply use Intel integrated graphics for a playable, but not excellent experience. Still, this is incredibly efficient for its gaming engine to do.\n\nThe reason I took off a star is because of the online experience. The two gaping flaws with it are the toxic community and the spotty development. Having an unfriendly community is one thing but to the point where hackers are abundantly crashing your game if they simply don't like you on their server is just ridiculous and petty. Completely defeats the purpose of giving the online experience a serious shot. In addition, making money is pretty much entirely dependent on being around a community that always hinders your endeavors just for the fun of irritating you, which would have been alright if the money making methods didn't pay out so little for the grandiose time it takes to make it. Which brings me to the development of this game; money is easy to hack in, hackers are abundant like birds in the servers, in game currency is laughably expensive, and no previously added piece of content is ever given improvement. What once felt like an expansive world to plunder and explore now is a condensed world of unnecessary and undesirable content ballooning to the point where it has popped and people are sick of playing and just want a new GTA installment already.\n\nDespite the online experience, this game is still one of the best in history as at least the single player experience is mind blowing and offers so much for what you pay for (or in the case of many new Epic Games players what you avoided paying for).\n6 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",4,6,Good

"Michael van Vuuren\n2 years ago\nMy opinion here, is mainly based on GTA online.\nI never loved a game so much and hated it so much at the same time. It is great in every way that a game should be, plays great and there is so much to do. \nUnfortunately it is let down by two things, other players and in game currency.\nThat may sound like two small problems, but believe me there is nothing as annoying as other players just blowing you and your car away for no good reason. You are being hunted by some snot nosed kids who have spend half their lives playing this game, those above level 150 players. So you have all these things to do on this beautifully created world, where your life is turned into a living nightmare by a few other players. So in a nutshell if just want to play the game like a normal person, it just wont happen. Too many snot nosed killers out there who have the best weapons, those irritating flying bikes that blows you into a black and white “waisted” slow motion screen. You then respawn and repeat.  That is basically GTA Online, it might just as well be called GTA Survive.  \nThen there is the money factor,  oh my oh my, things are so ridiculously priced that it is one of the biggest money making schemes. You can buy in game currency that costs more than the game itself, at what point did we allow this to happen? Oh yeah, it is those snot nosed kids spending all their cash on air scooters, and if you want to compete or at least stand a chance in this GTA world, you will also need to buy some in game currency and get one of those air scooters. It is actually sad that it turned out like this, one huge battlefield that actually have no purpose other than spoiling the game for other people. Why not go and play a pvp match, that is probably because this kind of behaviour is encouraged by the developer. But why? Because it is no longer about making a game that can be enjoyed by millions, it is about making millions. \nThe single player, remains one of the best game to date in my opinion, only sad to see the developers did not expand on that. \nI will not be surprised if the next GTA will be an online only game with no single player.\n6 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",2,6,Bad

"Joseph Shenay\n2 years ago\nThis game is perfect. I'm going to speak on the story mode and online in separate sections since Rockstar considers them separate games.\n\n\nSTORY MODE: Story mode is the first thing you will play when you enter the game, and people who only like online games might go straight to the online after doing the first couple of missions but in my opinion, that's doing the game a HUGE injustice. The story mode has a great plot, interesting characters, good to great missions, even compared to older gtas, and so much to do with all three characters. If you're going to buy the game just for online, you might as well give this a try, its truly great.\n\n\nONLINE: I am going to be reviewing online based on the game its self and not the player base. If I was reviewing on the player base than this game would be half a star. The game its self is great although. There is so much to do, you can own businesses, own apartments, garages, do tons of jobs/missions, own what seems like endless amounts of cars, planes, and other vehicles. You can have fun with your friends or just a public lobby. It is a grind, however. If you don't have much time to grind, or are not rich enough to buy shark cards than you might want a different online experience. If you are on pc, then expect a LOT of modders. Also expect a lot of tryhards in your lobby that will do nothing but try to kill you with an oppressor, which is a flying motorcycle with rockets, (I know, crazy). The game is also really confusing at first, but if you play it enough you will get it eventually.\n\n\nOVERALL: This game is amazing.

"Alan J.M\na year ago\nThis game is worth a buy. It's single-player campaign is cinema-like, but the franchise has had better voice acting in past titles. The online component is equally fun, and I recommend buying money credits off a third-party website. Online can offer a lot of playtime, you should be buying an Akula helicopter, Nightshark bulletproof SUV, and a Deluxo flying car. There are properties that go along with most of the good vehicles, like helicopters, and combat-vehicles, so its kind of ""SCAMMY"", but can still be fun.\n1 person found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,0,Good
"Richard IDGAF\n3 years ago\nThe story-mode is self-driven and rather exciting; just don't expect anything oscar worthy like The Last  Of Us. The character attachment is there - we like the dynamic trio that Rockstar has presented us with and they fit the bill quite nicely. Overall, story-mode is very intriguing with its singleplayer quirks and it will not let you down overall. It is indeed a very different experience.\n\nOnline mode: It's batshit insane - and not in the good way. If you're a newcomer, god bless your soul and pray to whomever you worship (if any) that you don't get griefed the second you log in. The oppression is very well reflected with greedy micro-transactions in the form of ''shark cards''. They over-inflate assets so that you fall for this tactic and cough up even more money so that you are later entangled in a highly irreversible cycle of spending. Proceed with caution...\n10 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",3,10,Normal
"Keshawn Jones\n2 years ago\nI give this a three stars because I don't know what Rockstar was thinking when they made the online portion of this game. Everything is extremely expensive and the shark cards are not worth it to buy. I feel like shark cards are just cash grabs instead of being a great way to get money for people who wants to spend their money on a video game to get in game items. Also, the story is great, I'm glad they added the DLC to online instead of the story mode, but anyways love the game online missions and heist they're very fun to play, but sometimes they take hours to finish. One thing I feel like that need to be worked on for the next 2-3 years (until GTA 6 comes out) is that you guys need to raise on how much money we earn on heist It's ridiculous that we have to earn that little bit of money just for us to spend it on something that is so expensive that it takes most of our money away. Then we have to spend the next few hours to get that money back It's annoying and such a stupid process. The glitches is the only way to get a lot of money, which people been doing for the past few years. I love this game and can't wait for the next installment.

"SAMRAWI DANIEL\n2 years ago\nGrand Theft Auto is a title that everyone knows. It’s the name of a series of games that helped define a generation, and in the 12 years since the third core game in the series helped push gaming into a larger spotlight.\n\nGaming has changed though. It’s been five years since GTA IV burst onto the scene, and in that gap between major GTA sequels, the genre has evolved. GTA V proves that it has what it takes to not only still be relevant , but to take survival of the fittest to a new level. It’s the kind of game that knows it comes from an older generation. But instead of trying to recapture that youth, GTA V instead runs with it and embraces that theme of old dogs staying true to form and celebrating what makes the franchise so damn popular in the first place.\n6 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",5,6,Good

Then the game glitches as I pick up the second key card and we lose one key card! We killed the whole compound to be sure but we had to restart the heist! What a waste of time!\n\n3) When we have to restart due to bugs etc one of the team will get kicked out no doubt. Please don’t waste your time just restart the whole heist. \n\n4) when you request you submarine it sometimes spawns on your helicopter (ON LAND!). \n\n5) the helicopter blows up so easy!? A bit of wind could kill the engine! \n\nOn the other hand, when the structures and floor isn’t see-through it is aesthetically pleasing to look at.\nNot a bad game, just need a lot of patience. \n\nAlso I have done the casino heist many, many times, but I cannot trade price for a casino car?

To do pretty much anything that gets you any money to progress in the game, you rely on or go against other players.\n\nObviously, it is multiplayer and that's to be expected, but the amount of times I've had my experience ruined by a cheating player is absurd. You can't make any progress on multiplayer because all of you money is lost over and over because cheating players can simply kick you out of your vehicle that's needed for the missions, blow you up, teleport you or themselves across the map, instantly crash your game and countless other ways of making you fail. I've really tried to give it a chance but it's unplayable if your goal is to actually play the game as intended.\n\nTo be honest, multiplayer is one of the main reasons I got this game and I'm regretting this purchase.

I'm super depressed, the doctor doesn't know what to do with me because so far every medicine he has given me hasn't worked. So, i decided to turn to gaming and by gaming i mean Grand Theft Auto V. It has given me the best thrills in the world, like when i go into my garage and see all of my expensive cars then swiftly realize how terrible my actual life is. And now that i realize that my life sucks i'm going to make a change and by change I mean I'm going to commit the various crimes i commit in gta in real life. I'm going to rob a rich man's island and i'm going to rob 50+ convenience stores and make sure my name is known kinda like R.

"Lukas Miglioranza\na month ago\nThe game is short, easy and not very pressing. It has the game engine on its side, but the game play already has considerable flaws. It takes longer to conquer all territories in GTA San Andreas than to finish this one. The protagonists have charisma, but some for one reason, some for another, are left unexpressed or ruined or ridiculed. Certainly online is something else, but thank you very much! With the whole world working on it!

"legendarylinks _\n2 years ago\nGta V online is a huge waste of time. There’s no level filtering so level 3 characters can be exploded as many times and the flying bikes and cars please, there is absolutely nothing stopping them. The only way to progress is to buy business that give you next to no money. Even if you get the businesses the level 9999 people can still blow you up and make you go back to step one every time. There’s absolutely no point in trying. The player base has gotten so toxic over the years. The car physics make no sense. You can be driving an 18 wheeler and run it over a tiny ramp and go 30 feet in the air. Drifting is nearly impossible as your car will just spin in circles for 10 minutes. Not worth 60 dollars.

The online version first takes sometimes 30 min to get on a server with your friends once you finally get on a server within the first 30 minutes of play and doing your missions a modder/hacker will come on and either kick everyone on server or mess up you missions. Then once you are kicked another up to 30 minutes to join your friends again to have it happen again. If you like to keep loading and actually not play the game yes go ahead and buy.. oh and don't expect Rockstar games to actually fix the problem.. lol they got there money don't care if you actually get to play fairly or even play the game.

Secondly, the vehicles you added like the Oppressor mk 2 is very broken due to how fast it is and the amount of missiles it can shoot.

Bit reluctant to even play it now when i had storymode plus a ton of extras completed and to start fresh 8 years in online is a joke!

"Dustin “dR4A” Foret\na year ago\nThe story is lackluster in its writing. Meanwhile the gameplay did not age well since 2013. I got this game day one back then, and while it was enjoyable initially, even back then I was disappointed by the crummy story and lack of side content. The end game; non-existent. The best part about the main game is the performances from the main cast. They are a blast to watch & play with. Weapon selection is limited, and money in this game is also very limited until AFTER the story ends. I get the idea, but even in the Red Dead series--in which there's less money in theory--there's a sense of progression. \n\nMeanwhile GTA Online, the only reason why the game can still be $60 and get a re-release for each console generations, is abysmal. I played it in the early years, and it was rough and generally not worthwhile. After taking a break from it then returning, I've soon discovered that it's more of the same toxic game design with a new coat of paint. The Cayo Perico Heist is supposed to be this game mode that evolves the franchise, gameplay, and story of GTA Online, but I believe nothing really changed. It leans heavily on purposely davatoged gameplay that influences the player to either rage quit or buy into microtransactions. I'm surprised it's lasted this long. And I don't think GTA as a series is going to get better. It peaked at GTA4 and it's dlc.\n\nIn the end GTA 5 and GTA Online both feel like a bad drug habit. They're tempting at first but the allure fades away fast and gets worse with time.\nWas this review helpful to you?\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",2,0,Bad

Max Materazzi\n2 years ago\nOne of the buggiest games I have ever played. My bunker is broken and won’t let me deliver supplies and it periodically happens for my other businesses. The heists take way to long to set up and if you don’t have 4 players you can’t even do the second heist. My friend decided to buy the arcade first so we could do the diamond casino heist and apparently he had to be a ceo first but the game didn’t tell him that. I have so much more to say and I only bought the game 4 days ago. It could be fun but they seem to not care about the bugs so it’s just unplayable.\n6 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful,1,6,Bad

"Corbin Edmonds\n2 years ago\nIt's a pretty fun game and very addicting. The story and gameplay is amazing. However, I gave it 3/5 because the online aspect could use some work. It takes quite a bit of grinding to earn money and if you choose to use actual money to buy GTA money, in my opinion, is very expensive for what you get. And you have to have tons of GTA money and grind like crazy to get the good stuff. For example, you can grind and buy a good armored vehicle, but then you end up having to buy a Pegasus to store it. Then you have to buy an operations center in order to sell or modify it. All of which is incredibly expensive and like I said before, takes forever to grind and earn money which shouldn't have to be that difficult. But otherwise, it's amazing.\n1 person found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",3,0,Normal

pokemon fanboy\na year ago\nThe game is still enjoyable after all of these years I have complaints with it mostly with the main story mode since I don't like multiplayer because I don't like playing online games the story now feels kinda bland even if I and many others still love the game's story and characters it deserves an update of sorts or some form of new content to spice the game up cause once you beat the main story or 100% the game there's nothing left to do some sort of dlc that adds a new campaign to story mode would liven things up like with the two new story campaigns in GTA 4 adding new guns and cars to single player even if it's just from online mode would spice things up if not then creating a new game all together improving and updating mechanics would be a huge improvement as well but realistically it'll never happen because of how much rockstar likes to beat the game's corps and add only to multiplayer but it would also fix other issues I have with the game as well such as the fact that you can't get away with anything and the police will be on you the moment you even think about doing something beat up a dude in a fist fight get swarmed by police shooting at you it gets more annoying because this is practically every time and with the massive penalty loosing money whenever you get caught or getting killed even on accident like falling off a building or getting run over you'll receive a it's not a fun mechanic even if that's how it's always been especially because getting money is a pain to do since there's no good way to earn big chunks of money after the game ends the stock market is random 90% of the time and barely gives a payout why not have repeatable heists that the player can go on also adding more to the heist partners too since the gimmick of them improving after every job becomes irrelevant since most of the time picking a low experienced member will cause them to die or get arrested I'd also like to see more enemies to fight like in Watchdogs 2 where there's various gang factions that own terratory with items like money or clothing you can steal from there is something like that already but they barely factor into the game at all\nWas this review helpful to you?\nHelpful\nUnhelpful,3,0,Normal

"Eds Workouts\na year ago\nGTA 5 is a game that is not for the faint of heart. There are missions (tasks, jobs) that are a bit disturbing and/or bothersome to some people.\nI had a hard time with doing some of the missions (tasks, jobs). But at the end of each there was a bit of humanity still there.\nThe storyline was great. The implementation of being able to swap between 3 characters makes game play a bit more engaging. The option to choose how to do missions (tasks, jobs) makes for various outcomes and most likely various different endings. I have only seen one so far.\nAs for the storyline. I give it a 4.75 out of 5. Mission (task, jobs). 3.75 out of 5. Some were complicated and some were easy. A bit to easy.

Graphics are good, story lines are good and there's so much to do so there's no getting bored.\nHowever, one thing that really annoys me is the controls. When driving fast on a mission and you slightly hit something along the way the car drastically spirals out of control and you either end up in a ditch or upside down which in returns means you haven't got enough time to complete the mission and you fail..\nAnother thing is the flying ...when flying a plane or helicopter its the worst controls..  you want to turn left and the whole plane flips on its side.. its the worst controls .\n3 people found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful",4,3,Good

Dan Gillman\n2 years ago\nThere never seems to be a clear explanation of when there will be a cut scene or when you need to do something in the game. Countless failed missions because of this. Controls are wonky at best especially while swimming or flying. \n\nThe game has a good story and like able characters but the execution is sloppy. \n\n Countless perks to play online- often advertising as “free” items. Playing on PSPlus is not free and therefore these items are not free either. That is a trap if I’ve ever seen one.\n\nHere’s hoping the following is better executed.\n1 person found this helpful.\nHelpful\nUnhelpful,2,0,Bad

      "Parsed: warning: spoilerstrevor is just love!! he has these tough guy looks and energetic and humorous dialog that makes him better than the other two characters. i think i'll spend the first few weeks playing only him before michael and franklin.i laughed so hard when he was shouting at the cops chasing after him,he isn't much of a hot-headed guy, he's cool most of the time(at least for the time i was free roaming).most of the gta fans see him as a sociopath but i think michael deserves to be called that too.a big thumbs up to the voice actors for bringing life into these characters.i started exploring the massive world gta v offers and i must say the craftsmanship is simply stunning. it is clear that it was designed and implemented by people who really wanted to produce something that was revolutionary, and without skimping on the details.it seems almost limitless. from ai cars flashing their high beams when you're driving on the wrong side of the road on a collision course with them, to the seamless integration of the radio stations with the world you're in, to . . . well, a dozen pages could be written on the details alone.the world is massive! if one word could sum up the game i think it would be 'detail'. every aspect of the game is as detailed as possible and it is easily the best game ever made respective of the technological possibility in 2013. for instance, the ai of the people walking down the street is almost creepy, it seems like these are living people. the dialog is truly impressive, i believe that this game could compete with some of the best films around.fantastic acting, worthy of film awards, breathtaking graphics, beyond realistic physics, and just enthralling game-play make this the first truly next-gen game that goes beyond just better graphics, pushing the limits of what i thought was possible.rockstar is genius for a making this game so immerse, so realistic, but yet manages to keep that funny, satiric gta feel. congrats rockstar, you deserve your success.\n",

      "Parsed: story mode: gta 5 is an action-based game that takes place in the state of san andreas but in the city of los santos. you play as three main protagonists, the first for a grand theft auto game. one of the characters you play as is michael townley who fakes his own death to get out of the life of crime under the witness protection of the fib under a new name, michael de santa. he's now living in los santos with his two children and his wife, amanda. our second main protagonist is franklin clinton. like michael, franklin results to a life of crime such as robbing liquor stores and warehouses, anything for some of the needed money. he too lives in los santos where he stays with his auntie, denise. franklin commits active crimes and does kill gang members but he isn't stupid and he tries to branch out from the hood life so him and his crush tanisha can live somewhere away from all of it. our third and final protagonist is trevor phillips. he is the first character in gta that actually works, his personality being a sociopathic narcissist who will kill for fun, actually matches the setting of randomly blowing things up and running people over. trevor and michael were buddies back in the old heist days, they'd do scores together until it all went south and michael faked his own death, leaving trevor m.i.a only to return later in the game watching the news and hearing about michael being potentially alive. this game is amazing, which is an understatement but the open world is gigantic with several different landmarks and terrain as you drive around. the gameplay feels smoother than it ever has before, with even faster cars, even bigger guns, and even more people to shoot at. the storyline might not be the most interesting, but actually being able to plan a heist and pick who you want to hack and drive and provide firearms is mental. making stupid decisions for a heist can also affect how it goes down, you may lose money, someone might die, it's just crazy how in-depth the game gets. the game can get slow at times but if you wanna take a break from the main story, do some side quests which are referred to as \"strangers and freaks\". 100% completion of this game doesn't come easy it will take some grinding and some time consumption in order to acquire the 100% you may need to watch youtube videos for help. overall the story mode to this game is top-notch and i give rockstar props for creating such a banger of a game.\n",

      "Parsed: grand theft auto v is a best action,adventure and a fps shooter game with 2 fascinating modes story mode and online mode, the developers done a very hard working procedure on making a spellboundic game with breathtaking euphoria physics. the overall story mode experience is 10/10 in my opinion with a lot of mind blowing easter eggs,secrets and plenty of more stuff and also the missions have variety of physics and realism. from 2011 the hype of grand theft auto v was from streets to the skies but it's still have a hype in 2020 like the developers rockstar games and rockstar north will make single player dlc unlike r* said on 2015 they won't make any dlc for story mode except online mode but now to remain and increase the hype and get milk i guess they will make a single player dlc which will not be free unlike gta online dlc updates,but then on 2013 the rockstar services wants to make the grand theft auto world a real living world by adding multiplayer features in game eh but in 2021 gta online will become a standalone game it will detach from gta v. so on gta online gives all players across the world a overheimengly positive living open world game experience of mutliplayer with tons of different cool dlc updates in game of online mode like refreshing the game mode with tons of various new activities so on the gta online mode made the whole game live a more better life and giving a lot profit for the developers like this game has sold a tons of copys from 2013 to 2020 and so on rockstar games made alot of money from a single game also their isn't a movie which scored a lot of money than gta v.well so i recommend this game to whom who haven't played yet i recommend it to play once and then you are going to live in this breathtaking open world game. the game is going to be expanded and enhanced on story mode after it's release on ps5. so hang on and hope for the best.\n",

      "Parsed: credit where credit is due, this game is fairly enjoyable.  the story mode is entertaining and engrossing, los santos and the surrounding area feels vibrant and alive, and there are a seemingly infinite amount of things to see and do.  that being said, once you get over the scope of the game and all the tiny details, you begin noticing all of the flawed/broken mechanics.  every car handles similarly, regardless of vehicle type, which is to say they all handle poorly.  traction control is applied at random, and is absent at launch, but present while cornering.  the most mundane econobox and the most visceral hypercar have relatively the same top speed, which isn't very high.  with that in mind, land vehicles are still the \"best\" mode of transportation, even better than walking.  on foot movement is slow and sloppy.  precise movement is near impossible.  your character will ragdoll for the silliest of reasons, from trying to walk up a hill, to literally walking on a flat path.  helicopters are the worst.  piloting them ranges from slightly annoying to an all-out nightmare.  flying forward reduces altitude, stopping quickly throws the vehicle in to a fit.  engaging enemy aircraft is an exercise in anger management.  firearms are clunky and underpowered.  anything short of a headshot requires an excessive amount of rounds to down an enemy combatant, exacerbated by a poorly implemented auto aim system, which is all but necessary when playing with a controller.  the system struggles with even minimal visual obstruction (foliage, leaves), and loses targets at the worst possible moment.the story mode has all but been abandoned, not seeing any significant update in years.  all of r*s attention has been focused on the online portion, which doesn't bode well for their dev team.  load times are insane, lobbies are always overcrowded, and the servers crash constantly, most notably after finishing an activity.  speaking of the online experience, prepare for one of the most toxic multiplayer experiences to date.  trying to accomplish a delivery mission?  some griefer on an oppressor is about to ruin your day.  trying to perform one of the randomly generated community events, like driving the longest distance without crashing?  one of the npcs just crossed the street and t-boned you, even though there is nowhere for them to go on your side of the road (this behavior has apparently been hard coded into the game, because why wouldn't it be?).  so, aside from server issues, enemy players constantly harassing you, and suicidal npcs flocking towards your speeding vehicle, the rest of the experience is pleasant, right?  no.  the absolute worst aspect of the online mode, and the game as a whole, is the economy.  everything is grossly inflated compared to the story mode (e.g. $1,000,000+ for a honda civic, $15,000 shoes), and getting any meaningful amount of money requires grinding the same heists over and over (most of which require a crew and don't pay well), selling goods via your various companies (which also require help, or payout less if completed solo), the new solo compatible cayo perico heist (which is plagued with it's own laundry list of bugs and design flaws), or of course, shark cards (microtransactions), because if you're going to punish your fanbase for playing your over hyped game, why not hit them where they are the most vulnerable: their wallet?\n",

      "Parsed: on launch day, i was one of the people that preordered the power armor edition not even 4 hours after it became available. after hearing so many bad reviews and general disgust about the game, i was worried that the fallout 76 game i decided to take a chance in and play was going to be shelved and done with in one to two months from launch date like other games i have played. boy was i wrong. at first, it seemed very hard to grasp whether bethesda would commit and improve the game. however, since being in the beta stages for the game, i have seen the game improved drastically. sure, it is not all clean and polished but they are putting updates out every two weeks, which says a lot in terms of improving the game. they have included more patches and fixes to previously buggy and game breaking gameplay. i just wanted to get the correct information out there so i will be explaining some of things they have done so you can see the work they put in for the last 5 to 6 months. i have enjoyed steady and more stable server use as the months go on since launch date. they are cracking down on anything that is viewed as cheating (duping weapons and modded versions of the game). they have increased the storage size to twice the amount since release date, i hope they increase it more in future updates. they even had time to add more content to this game, and they are working on getting more patches. dungeon will be coming out (so excited to fight strong enemies whenever i enter with a group to see how far we can go). they have made a survival mode pvp server worlds that are different and separate from the pve server worlds in case you do not like pvp and just want to explore the world (also they have implemented a new system where if someone attacks you, you will not receive damage or die from the attacker unless you attack them back). i haven't really come across players that are mean or want to make sure you have a bad time in fallout 76. for example, i met a good player the other day who gave me a ton of serum mutations that cost about 60-70k in total caps (which is hard to get that amount in fallout 76 especially from vendors) for free without wanting anything in return. apparently, he gives them out for free to anyone that needs help. so i don't believe everyone in fallout 76 are toxic players, but some of us try to help each other out when we can. i have enjoyed being able to name my stuff, have stronger and  more farsighted turrets than before.  they have changed the mechanics of some monsters (scorchbeast as an example and spamming attacks). they have fixed more quest buggy issues and helped pool vendors caps together so you dont have to run around looking for caps. they made sure to let vendors have multitude of notes so you don't rely on rng to get the plan you need for a gun or power armor part. they have gotten rid of the spawning issue for robots in whitesprings. they have started putting good stuff in atomic shop like cool looking power armor. they have put a news and announcement board when you enter into the game. they added a new battle royale mode and already started putting out updates to fix the battle royale mode. also, they are planning to release human npcs, which will be an awesome addition to the game along with vault raids! nice! these are just some of the updates they have been doing since the game launched and they have been true to their word doing two updates every single month. i am eager to see what other updates they have going forward. also, i have received my new canvas bag, which looks nice if i might add. they fulfilled their promise to deliver this bag in the timeframe they gave us so i do not feel like they scammed me or anything. to me, every dollar well spent, and i am in no way regretting my purchase unlike how others have been making it seem with the classic \"people are still playing this game?\" i can assure you others are playing and like me we will be playing it for quite a while.\n",

      "Parsed: my go-to game when i've had enough of the real world and want to escape reality for some time. expands well upon that one mechanic every other gta title missed - immersion. drive around the posh vinewood streets looking for exotic sports cars or explore the grand senora desert and expect random encounters with muggers or hitchhikers, or take a u-turn and climb mt. chiliad, to feel on top of the world. the game comes with endless hours of gameplay even after completing all the missions, and the first-person mode coupled with your own tracks makes even aimless driving feel fun. the only downside is the wanted level system, which activates even when you stealthily kill a random npc in the middle of the desert in the dead of the night. nevertheless, the game is efficiently optimized on all its ports, which allows it to run even on low-end machines. the gameplay physics is spectacular, but in no way you must expect it to be near real-life since gta v's not supposed to be a simulation game. in the end, this game will make you forget all your real-life problems for a while, as you step into the shoes of either franklin, michael or trevor and feel the los santos sensation.\n",

      "Parsed: after i joined college i started playing pc games, and that was the time i began learning about gaming outside of nintendo. open world games were something that really fascinated me, so that was the genre i started from. i played assassin's creed and watch_dogs, but i didn't understand why normies liked gta so much. i thought it must be because they don't know about bigger ad cooler games, until i tried gta v myself. and i have to say, boy was i so wrong! this really is something unique, something i couldn't get in any other open world aaa game i had played to that point.gta v is something i'd call the era defining game of our time. it has everything we want: a good story, interesting characters, a dynamic open world, interactive npcs and most importantly, it can run on any device (other than nintendo and mobile phones). i have a habit of playing games linearly, that is, going from point a to point b. i only care about the story of a game and explore the open world only after i complete the main story mode, so that i can delete the game in case my laptop starts going slow (it's an nvidia 940mx), and also because i have too many unplayed games in my library and i'd choose to finish them rather than look at a game whose story i've already completed.and that made it even more engaging; because the story is really gripping and funny at the same time. in the beginning i was annoyed when michael was shown the first time, putting his gun on franklin's head. but after michael's family left him i was really interested in knowing how he will fix things back. but then the scene shifted to trevor. i was really annoyed, and i would always shift to michael to finish his quests. but after i replayed the game after it became free on epic, i realised trevor's story was the funniest of them all. now trevor has become my favourite character of the three.the graphics are really realistic. and the best part is, if you have a high end pc you can download mods to make the game look as realistic as possible. there are even mods for bringing your own characters like superman or hulk, and the best part is that rockstar, unlike other aaa companies (read nintendo) encourages players to do it rather than punish them for the same. the npcs are also very interactive. they behave just like how any person in real life would. being an indie game developer myself i know how much effort goes behind doing this.just by looking at gta v you can see how much love the developers poured into making it. the game has been available for every console from the 7th generation and will also be for the 9th generation. gaming companies should learn from rockstar and take this example for their games too (especially ubisoft, assassin's creed ii would have been so awesome if it was remastered for ps5 and xbox series x). i really hope gta vi is able to outperform this game. they can take as much time as they want, i have no problem with it.\n",

      "Parsed: grand theft auto v has an average metacritic score of 97% across all platforms it's been released on, and is currently the third best selling game of all time, right behind tetris and minecraft. for both the average player and the long time rockstar fan who has seen the series evolve into what it is now, it's not difficult to see why: you play as three different characters--who all have their own unique backgrounds, goals, and motivations--in a surprisingly large and detailed satirical (and arguably accurate) replica of los angeles and the surrounding california area (dubbed los santos and san andreas respectively), where our three protagonists end up working together to pull off various heists while simultaneously trying to get out of the mess they've been pulled into.but what if i told you, seven years after it's release, across two generations of consoles, the story and character development wasn't the key to this game's success?that end is owed to it's online counterpart. which is, in many cases, for better or for worse.since grand theft auto online (gtao)'s release, the game has received several updates, ranging from customizable races that would make any person who grew up with hot wheels scream in joy, more replicas and mashups of existing cars available for purchase than the average player knows what to do with, to a casino and purchasable high-end apartments that allows you to plan heists with your friends. that being said, if you're new to this game, you're going to be extremely overwhelmed for what is major update upon major update, and phone calls upon phone calls telling you to buy a facility or a bunker. that, combined with the abyssmal loading times (which has been dubbed by the player base as \"cloud simulator 2013\"), is something that will ward off many players.and that's not even covering the massive amount of tryhards and the wide array of weaponized vehicles they will use to stop you from making money in the game. and in order to make money in this game, you're going to have to grind repetitive missions and tasks in order to do it. a lot.if you don't enjoy games that rely heavily on grinding in order to advance, along with the problems and how easy it is for another player to ruin it all, this may not be the game for you. and if you think rockstar games will go out of their way to make it easier: they won't. all because it pushes shark card sales (what gtao uses as monetization) so they can further make money in an investment they made seven years ago.so, to conclude this review, i'm leaving an open letter to any higher-up rockstar employee who reads this: you're already one of the biggest game dev giants, you have nine studios that you've ended up buying out and putting under your portfolio, and five of your titles are well within the top fifty bestselling games of all time excluding this one.why do you feel the need to further monetize your games with an online counterpart that has some form of a paid premium? why in the world is it never enough?with dan houser out of the picture from here on out starting next month, you need to be incredibly careful with your future titles. i fear the worst for grand theft auto vi.tl;dr version: story is alright and there's plenty to do, but if you're going to try out gtao take it with a grain of salt\n",

      "Parsed: gta online is also a noteworthy game to play and it has plenty of pros and cons in its own right. the ability to acquire properties, businesses, compete and/or cooperate with players makes this game an immersive experience and it makes you feel like you mature with your character. you will see your character grow from being a petty criminal doing small time jobs for lamar and gerald to becoming a successful mastermind criminal. while this model is rewarding, it is difficult and tedious to move up the ranks. this is especially true for those who are full time students and full time employees because they are time constrained. if you are time constrained, barely starting gta online, and still want to have fun in gta online i do suggest you purchase the criminal mastermind starter pack with is roughly $10. i added additional tips to save you the time from watching clickbait 10+ minute youtube videos.the criminal starter pack will give you $1 million, a ceo office, an apartment, mc clubhouse, vehicles, weapons, and clothes. these properties might not be the best locations, but they are a good way to start earning money and once you save up enough money you can get better locations. with the money you earn i do suggest you avoid splurging it on vehicles. the only vehicles worth buying right away is the kuruma and the oppressor. the kuruma will protect you when you do missions and the oppressor allows you to travel quickly across the map. for aircraft, invest in a buzzard and a cargobob. the buzzard is a great helicopter to use in missions due to its agility and its weapons allow easy kills. being a ceo also allows you to spawn a ceo in most situations. the cargobob is a must have if you intend to import and export vehicles.\n",

(cars in gta 5 all feel the same, all luxury cars with supercar like acceleration even on thing like a family sedan) but that's not that bad compared to the online aspect.the online mode to this game that rockstar always promotes is not great. at all. with load times being around 10-ish minutes, and frequent disconnects the game can be borderline unplayable sometimes. the online is 𝐩𝐚𝐲 𝐭𝐨 𝐰𝐢𝐧 and is not fun to play at all, as a new player you are constantly thrown around by modders who rockstar does not punish or even make an attempt to fix. this and the fact that grand theft auto online is not a gta game, with flying motorcycles that can shoot 4 rockets per second, tracer bullets, explosive bullets, invincible cars, flying cars, homing missiles, and so much worse the game plays like an eight year old's dream. not a grand theft auto title. if i'm going to be honest here i would downright say that grand theft auto online is more of a saint's row clone than anything else. if you were looking for a grand theft auto online experience that fits with what the series has been for 20+ years, i would reccomend modding this game and getting the 5m mod, or you could get san andreas multiplayer (better in my opinion) what is essentially gta with 300 other players. it's disappointing such a series has fallen so far i think i may never play the next grand theft auto game (if it ever comes out) because if this is what grand theft auto is now,\n",
